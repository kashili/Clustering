# Clustering
The community contains
*topics* for question or discussion. Consider the following *subjects*
of user-posted topics.
* Does Anyone Whitelist TLDs for Web Browsing?
* Whats the best Internet Filter?
* Encrypting all sensitive data carried around on USB sticks
* Setting up a new office for cloud usage, do I really need an onsite
firewall?


We would like to segment topics based on their text in a way that
might eventually capture the interests of users posting or visiting
those topics. In the file community_security_topics.csv, you will find
text data (subject and body) for topics that have been posted in
*Security* forums; task is to build a model to sub-segment the
security topics and develop a story about what those sub-segments mean
for the users visiting them.
One possible sub-segmentation might be:
1. Endpoint Security
2. Network Security
3. Cloud Security
4. Database Security
5. Data Security & Compliance
You can take this example as a prescribed sub-segmentation and
classify topics based on it or come up with your own sub-segmentation.
